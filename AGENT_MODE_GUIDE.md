# Agent Mode Guide

## What is Agent Mode?

Agent Mode transforms the SEO assistant from a responsive tool into a proactive strategic partner. Instead of just answering your questions, it thinks deeply about your SEO challenges and guides you through a comprehensive strategy.

## Key Differences: Ask vs Agent Mode

### Ask Mode (Default)
- **You're in control**: You tell it exactly what to do
- **Direct responses**: Quick, focused answers to specific questions
- **Command-based**: "Research keywords for X", "Analyze example.com"
- **Best for**: Specific tasks, quick lookups, experienced SEO practitioners

### Agent Mode (Strategic)
- **AI-guided workflow**: It takes initiative and plans the approach
- **Strategic thinking**: Deep analysis with chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Opinionated advice**: Data-driven recommendations on what to prioritize
- **Best for**: Building strategies, comprehensive site audits, learning SEO

## What Makes Agent Mode Different?

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Every response includes hidden strategic analysis:
- Situation assessment (what you're trying to achieve)
- Strategic considerations (opportunities and challenges)
- Recommended approach (why this path makes sense)
- Next steps (how to move forward)

### 2. Strategic Framework
Agent mode doesn't just list keywords - it builds a framework:
- **Content Pillars**: 3-5 main topical themes
- **Keyword Clusters**: Supporting keywords grouped by intent
- **3-Tier Priority System**:
  - Tier 1 (Quick Wins): Target these NOW
  - Tier 2 (Authority Building): Build topical authority
  - Tier 3 (Long-term): Aspirational competitive terms

### 3. Opinionated SEO Guidance
Agent mode has strong opinions backed by data:
- Volume isn't everything (intent matters more)
- Content clustering beats thin pages
- Match content format to search intent
- Don't chase impossible keywords early
- Quality content > keyword stuffing

### 4. Competitive Intelligence
Goes beyond just showing data:
- Analyzes who's ranking and why
- Identifies content gaps competitors miss
- Suggests specific angles to differentiate
- Estimates realistic ranking timelines

## When to Use Agent Mode

### ✅ Perfect for Agent Mode:

**1. Starting a new SEO strategy**
```
"I'm launching a SaaS tool for project management, help me build an SEO strategy"
```
→ Agent will analyze your space, identify content pillars, build keyword clusters, prioritize actions

**2. Comprehensive site audits**
```
"Analyze example.com and tell me what SEO opportunities I'm missing"
```
→ Agent will crawl the site, analyze current state, identify gaps, build action plan

**3. Competitive analysis**
```
"I want to outrank competitor.com for project management keywords"
```
→ Agent will research competitor, find their keywords, identify weaknesses, build attack strategy

**4. Learning SEO strategy**
```

```

**5. Complex decisions**

```

**2. Specific tool commands**
```

```

**3. Simple questions**

```

## Example Agent Mode Interaction

### User Input:
```
I run a web design agency targeting small businesses. 
My site is example.com - help me build an SEO strategy.
```

### Agent Mode Response:

**[Internal Chain-of-Thought - Hidden from User]**
```
Situation Analysis:
- Web design agency, targeting small businesses (local/regional likely important)
- Need to balance service pages (transactional) with educational content (attract early-stage)
- Competitive space, but niches exist (industry-specific, location-based)

Strategic Considerations:
- Quick wins: Location + service keywords ("web design [city]")
- Authority building: Small business web design guides
- Differentiation: Industry expertise (e.g., "web design for restaurants")
- Local SEO critical (Google Business Profile, local citations)

Recommended Approach:
1. Crawl their site to see current state
2. Research location-based keywords
3. Identify 3-5 industry verticals to target
4. Build content cluster strategy
5. Check competitor positioning
```

**[Visible Strategic Response to User]**
```
I'll help you build a comprehensive SEO strategy for your web design agency. 
Let me start by analyzing your current site and researching your competitive landscape.

[Automatically crawls example.com]
[Automatically researches "web design small business" keywords]

**Current State Analysis:**
Your site has strong portfolio work but limited content targeting client searches. 
You're not currently ranking for high-intent service keywords in your area.

**Strategic Opportunity:**
I see three main paths to rank quickly and build authority:

📍 **Path 1: Local Dominance (Quick Wins - Start Here)**
Target location-based service keywords where competition is lower:
- "web design [your city]" (500 searches/mo, LOW competition)
- "website designer [your city]" (300 searches/mo, LOW competition)

→ Create location pages with case studies + optimize Google Business Profile

🏢 **Path 2: Industry Expertise (Authority Building)**
Specialize in 2-3 specific industries you serve:
- "restaurant website design" (1,200 searches/mo, MEDIUM competition)
- "law firm web design" (800 searches/mo, MEDIUM competition)

→ Build comprehensive industry guides showing your expertise

📚 **Path 3: Educational Content (Long-term Authority)**
Answer questions your ideal clients search for:
- "how much does a website cost for small business" (2,400 searches/mo)
- "do I need a website for my business" (1,800 searches/mo)

→ Create guides that funnel to your services

**My Recommendation:**
Start with Path 1 (local keywords) because:
1. Lower competition means faster results (2-3 months vs 6-12)
2. Higher commercial intent (ready to hire)
3. Builds momentum and case studies for Paths 2 & 3

Or should I analyze a competitor to see what's working for them?

## Strategic Frameworks in Agent Mode

### 1. Content Pillar Strategy
Agent mode groups keywords into strategic themes:

```
Pillar: "Small Business Web Design"
├─ Supporting Content: "web design cost calculator"
├─ Supporting Content: "website vs social media for business"
├─ Supporting Content: "how to choose a web designer"
└─ Service Page: "small business web design services"

Internal linking flows from supporting content → pillar → service page
```

### 2. Search Intent Segmentation
Keywords are analyzed by user intent:

- **Informational**: "what is responsive web design" → Blog post
- **Commercial**: "best web design agencies" → Comparison/review page
- **Transactional**: "web design services near me" → Service page
- **Navigational**: "[brand name] web design" → Brand page

### 3. Opportunity Scoring
Agent mode prioritizes using:
```
Opportunity Score = (Search Volume × Intent Score) ÷ (Competition + 1)

High opportunity = Good volume + Low competition + High intent
```

### 4. Realistic Timeline Estimation
Based on competition analysis:
- **Quick Wins** (0-3 months): Low competition, clear content gap
- **Medium Term** (3-6 months): Medium competition, need quality content + some links
- **Long Term** (6-12+ months): High competition, need authority + comprehensive content + strong backlink profile

## Best Practices for Using Agent Mode

### 1. Provide Context
The more context you give, the better the strategy:

❌ **Vague**: "Help me with SEO"
✅ **Specific**: "I run a B2B SaaS for email marketing, 6-month runway, need leads fast"

### 2. Ask Follow-up Questions
Agent mode builds on conversation:
```
User: "I like the quick wins approach"
Agent: "Great! Let me research the specific keywords for [your location]..."
```

### 3. Challenge Recommendations
Agent mode can explain its reasoning:
```
User: "Why not target the 10K search volume keyword?"
Agent: "Let me show you the SERP for that - all results are from huge brands with 
        90+ domain authority. You'd need 6-12 months and significant backlinks to compete.
        The 500 search/month keyword has small agencies ranking, you can win in 2-3 months."
```

### 4. Share Your Constraints
Help agent mode tailor recommendations:
- Budget constraints ("bootstrapped, limited budget")
- Time constraints ("need results in 3 months")
- Resource constraints ("just me, no team")
- Technical constraints ("non-technical, can't code")

### 5. Be Specific About Goals
Different goals = different strategies:
- "I want leads" → Transactional keywords, conversion optimization
- "I want to build an audience" → Informational content, email capture
- "I want to be seen as an expert" → Thought leadership, high-value content
- "I want to rank for brand terms" → Competitive defense strategy

## Tips for Maximum Value

### 1. Start Broad, Get Specific
```
1. "Help me with SEO for my SaaS" (agent provides framework)
2. "Focus on the quick wins approach" (agent dives deeper)
3. "Show me specific keywords for Path 1" (agent pulls data)
```

### 2. Save Important Insights
Use the pin feature to save key recommendations:
```
User: "Pin this content strategy"
Agent: [Uses pin_important_info tool automatically]
```

### 3. Iterate on Strategy
```
User: "This looks good but I have no budget for backlinks"
Agent: "Let me adjust the strategy to focus on low-competition keywords 
        that don't require backlinks to rank..."
```

### 4. Ask "Why"
Agent mode can explain its reasoning:
```
User: "Why suggest informational content first?"
Agent: "Your domain is new (3 months old, low authority). Transactional keywords 
        like '[service] near me' are dominated by established businesses with 
        strong local signals. Informational content lets you build topical authority 
        first, then the transactional keywords become easier in 4-6 months..."
```
