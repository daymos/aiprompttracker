## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Provide Context
Instead of: "Help me with SEO"
Better: "I run a B2B SaaS for email marketing, 6-month runway, need leads fast"

### 2. Include Your URL
Agent Mode can automatically analyze your site when you provide the URL.

### 3. Mention Constraints
- Budget: "bootstrapped startup, limited budget"
- Timeline: "need results in 3 months for investor meeting"
- Resources: "just me, no team"
- Technical: "non-technical founder"

### 4. Be Specific About Goals
- "I want leads" (conversion focus)
- "I want to build an audience" (community focus)
- "I want to be seen as an expert" (authority focus)
- "I want to sell the blog eventually" (traffic/revenue focus)

### 5. Ask Follow-up Questions
Agent Mode builds on conversation. Don't hesitate to:
- Challenge recommendations: "Why not target the 10K volume keyword?"
- Ask for clarification: "Can you explain search intent?"
- Request alternatives: "What if I don't have budget for backlinks?"
- Dive deeper: "Tell me more about the quick wins strategy"

## What Makes a Good Agent Mode Prompt?

### ✅ Good Examples:

**Context-Rich:**
```
I'm a freelance copywriter building my personal brand. 
My site is [yoursite.com]. I want to rank for copywriting services 
in my city (Boston) but also attract remote clients. How do I balance this?
```

**Goal-Oriented:**
```
My SaaS has 100 free users but no paid conversions. 
Site is [yoursite.com]. I think SEO can help me reach my ICP (marketing directors at B2B companies). 
Help me build a strategy that drives qualified leads.
```

**Situation-Specific:**
```
I have a successful Instagram following (50K) but my website gets no traffic. 
Site is [yoursite.com]. I want to monetize through SEO + affiliate marketing. 
What's my strategy?
```

### ❌ Vague Examples (Agent Mode will still help, but will need more back-and-forth):
