## 🎨 Main Description (Product Hunt)

### The Problem We're Solving

**Traditional SEO platforms are expensive and overcomplicated.**

You want to do SEO for your website. But here's what you get instead:

❌ **Ahrefs**: $129/month. 50+ features. Takes days to learn. You'll use 5 of them.  
❌ **SEMrush**: $199/month. Built for agencies managing 50 clients. You have 1 website.  
❌ **Mangools**: Simpler, but still 5 separate tools to master.

**Here's the truth:** 80% of SEO results come from **5 core fundamentals:**

1. Finding the right keywords
2. Tracking your rankings  
3. Analyzing competition
4. Fixing technical issues
5. Building quality backlinks

Everything else? Nice to have. Not essential.

**We stripped away the bloat and built a tool focused on what actually works.**

---

### How Keywords.chat is Different

**We focused on the core SEO fundamentals that actually provide value.**

No content gap analysis. No keyword cannibalization reports. No 17 types of backlink metrics you'll never understand.

Just the essentials:

✅ **Keyword Research** - "What keywords should I target?" → Get search volume, competition, suggestions  
✅ **Rank Tracking** - "Check my rankings" → See your positions and changes  
✅ **SERP Analysis** - "Who ranks for X?" → Understand the competition  
✅ **Site Audits** - "Find SEO issues" → Get actionable fixes  
✅ **Backlink Analysis** - "Show competitor backlinks" → Find link opportunities

**Delivered through conversation, not confusing menus.**

💬 Just ask: *"What keywords should I target for my SaaS landing page?"*  
→ Get everything you need in 10 seconds, not 20 minutes of clicking.

---

### What You Get (The Core Fundamentals)

✅ **Keyword Research** - Search volume, competition, opportunity keywords  
✅ **Rank Tracking** - Monitor 300+ keywords with daily updates  
✅ **SERP Analysis** - See who's ranking and what they're doing right  
✅ **Backlink Analysis** - Find quality link opportunities  
✅ **Website Audits** - Actionable technical SEO fixes  
✅ **AI Guidance** - Plain English explanations, not just numbers

**Everything proven to move the needle. Nothing you'll never use.**

**All for $59/month, not $199.**

---

### Who It's For

👨‍💻 **Indie hackers** who need SEO but not 50 enterprise features  
🚀 **Startup founders** who want results, not dashboards to learn  
📝 **Bloggers** who need the essentials without the $129/mo price tag  
💼 **Freelancers** tired of complex tools they use 20% of  
🏢 **Small agencies** managing 5-10 clients, not 100

**If you've ever paid $129/mo and only used a handful of features, this is for you.**

---

### Pricing That Makes Sense

| Tool | Price | Features | What You'll Use |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Ahrefs** | $129/mo | 50+ features | ~5 features (10%) |
| **SEMrush** | $199/mo | 55+ features | ~5 features (9%) |
| **Mangools** | $38-98/mo | 5 separate tools | Most of them ✅ |
| **Keywords.chat** | **$59/mo** | **5 core essentials** | **100% of them** ✅ |

**We give you only what actually works. At half the price.**

---

### Built by Someone Who Got Frustrated Too

I'm an indie hacker who got tired of:
- Paying $129/month and using 5 features out of 50
- Watching YouTube tutorials to learn tools, not SEO
- Feeling overwhelmed by reports I didn't understand

**I realized:** Most SEO tools are built for agencies managing 100 clients. I just needed the fundamentals for my one website.

So I built the tool I wish existed: **Core SEO essentials. Simple interface. Fair price.**

No bloat. No confusion. Just what works.

## 🎬 First Comment (Maker Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Mattia, and I built Keywords.chat because I was tired of SEO tools that feel like piloting a spaceship.

**The problem:** I wanted to check if "best project management tool" was worth targeting. With Ahrefs, I had to:
1. Find the Keyword Explorer menu
2. Configure location settings
3. Export data to see all metrics
4. Open SERP analysis in a new tool
5. Cross-reference with rank tracker

**20 minutes later**, I had my answer.

**With Keywords.chat, I just asked:**  
*"Is 'best project management tool' a good keyword to target?"*

Got the answer in 10 seconds. Search volume, competition, current rankings, top competitors—all explained in plain English.

---

### What makes it different?

**1. Actually conversational**  
Not a chatbot slapped onto a dashboard. Every SEO feature works through natural conversation.

**2. Built for speed**  
Ask questions, get answers. No 17-step workflows.

**3. Affordable for indie hackers**  
$59/month vs $129-199 for competitors. Real SEO data, not estimates.

---

### What you can do (live now):

✅ Keyword research with search volume  
✅ SERP competition analysis  
✅ Rank tracking (300+ keywords)  
✅ Backlink analysis  
✅ Website SEO audits  
✅ Multi-location tracking  

**All by just asking questions.**

---

### Who it's for:

If you've ever felt overwhelmed by Ahrefs or SEMrush, this is for you. If you're building a product and need "good enough" SEO without becoming an expert, this is for you.

---

### Pricing & Launch Offer:

🎉 **Early adopters: $59/month (normally $99)**  
🎁 **7-day free trial, no credit card**  
🚀 **Launching publicly next week**

## 🎯 Hunter Outreach Template

**Subject:** Chat-based SEO tool you might want to hunt

Hey [Name],

I'm launching Keywords.chat on Product Hunt next week—the first truly conversational SEO tool.

**Traction:** 200+ waitlist signups, built by an indie hacker (me) who got frustrated with existing tools.

I'm excited to launch Keywords.chat on Product Hunt today! 🎉

After years of using Ahrefs and SEMrush, I realized something:

Most people don't need 50 features. They need answers to simple questions:

So I built the first truly conversational SEO tool. No dashboards. No tutorials. Just ask questions in plain English and get insights instantly.

Perfect for:
✅ Indie hackers
✅ Startup founders
✅ Bloggers
✅ Small agencies

Same data as $129/mo tools, but for $59/mo and zero learning curve.
