SHORT DESCRIPTION (260 characters)
----------------------------------
Traditional SEO tools are expensive and bloated with features you'll never use. Keywords.chat gives you the core SEO fundamentals that actually work—keyword research, rank tracking, SERP analysis—through simple conversation. $59/mo, not $199.


MAIN DESCRIPTION
----------------

THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

Traditional SEO platforms are expensive and overcomplicated.

You want to do SEO for your website. But here's what you get instead:

× Ahrefs: $129/month. 50+ features. Takes days to learn. You'll use 5 of them.
× SEMrush: $199/month. Built for agencies managing 50 clients. You have 1 website.
× Mangools: Simpler, but still 5 separate tools to master.

Here's the truth: 80% of SEO results come from 5 core fundamentals:

1. Finding the right keywords
2. Tracking your rankings
3. Analyzing competition
4. Fixing technical issues
5. Building quality backlinks

Everything else? Nice to have. Not essential.

We stripped away the bloat and built a tool focused on what actually works.


HOW KEYWORDS.CHAT IS DIFFERENT

We focused on the core SEO fundamentals that actually provide value.

No content gap analysis. No keyword cannibalization reports. No 17 types of backlink metrics you'll never understand.

Just the essentials:

✓ Keyword Research - "What keywords should I target?" → Get search volume, competition, suggestions
✓ Rank Tracking - "Check my rankings" → See your positions and changes
✓ SERP Analysis - "Who ranks for X?" → Understand the competition
✓ Site Audits - "Find SEO issues" → Get actionable fixes
✓ Backlink Analysis - "Show competitor backlinks" → Find link opportunities

Delivered through conversation, not confusing menus.

💬 Just ask: "What keywords should I target for my SaaS landing page?"
→ Get everything you need in 10 seconds, not 20 minutes of clicking.


WHAT YOU GET (THE CORE FUNDAMENTALS)

✓ Keyword Research - Search volume, competition, opportunity keywords
✓ Rank Tracking - Monitor 300+ keywords with daily updates
✓ SERP Analysis - See who's ranking and what they're doing right
✓ Backlink Analysis - Find quality link opportunities
✓ Website Audits - Actionable technical SEO fixes
✓ AI Guidance - Plain English explanations, not just numbers

Everything proven to move the needle. Nothing you'll never use.

All for $59/month, not $199.


WHO IT'S FOR

• Indie hackers who need SEO but not 50 enterprise features
• Startup founders who want results, not dashboards to learn
• Bloggers who need the essentials without the $129/mo price tag
• Freelancers tired of complex tools they use 20% of
• Small agencies managing 5-10 clients, not 100

If you've ever paid $129/mo and only used a handful of features, this is for you.


PRICING COMPARISON

Tool          Price      Features         What You'll Use
------------------------------------------------------------
Ahrefs        $129/mo    50+ features     ~5 features (10%)
SEMrush       $199/mo    55+ features     ~5 features (9%)
Mangools      $38-98/mo  5 separate tools Most of them ✓
Keywords.chat $59/mo     5 core essentials 100% of them ✓

We give you only what actually works. At half the price.


WHY I BUILT THIS

I'm an indie hacker who got tired of:
- Paying $129/month and using 5 features out of 50
- Watching YouTube tutorials to learn tools, not SEO
- Feeling overwhelmed by reports I didn't understand

I realized: Most SEO tools are built for agencies managing 100 clients. I just needed the fundamentals for my one website.

So I built the tool I wish existed: Core SEO essentials. Simple interface. Fair price.

No bloat. No confusion. Just what works.

MAKER COMMENT (First Comment on Launch)
=========================================

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm Mattia, and I built Keywords.chat because I was tired of SEO tools that feel like piloting a spaceship.

THE PROBLEM

I wanted to check if "best project management tool" was worth targeting. With Ahrefs, I had to:
1. Find the Keyword Explorer menu
2. Configure location settings
3. Export data to see all metrics
4. Open SERP analysis in a new tool
5. Cross-reference with rank tracker

20 minutes later, I had my answer.

With Keywords.chat, I just asked:
"Is 'best project management tool' a good keyword to target?"

Got the answer in 10 seconds. Search volume, competition, current rankings, top competitors—all explained in plain English.


WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT

1. Core fundamentals only
Not 50 features you'll never use. Just the 5 things that actually move the needle in SEO.

2. Actually conversational
Not a chatbot slapped onto a dashboard. Every SEO feature works through natural conversation.

3. Built for speed
Ask questions, get answers. No 17-step workflows.

4. Affordable for indie hackers
$59/month vs $129-199 for competitors. Real SEO data, not estimates.


WHAT YOU CAN DO (LIVE NOW)

✓ Keyword research with search volume
✓ SERP competition analysis
✓ Rank tracking (300+ keywords)
✓ Backlink analysis
✓ Website SEO audits
✓ Multi-location tracking

All by just asking questions.


WHO IT'S FOR

If you've ever felt overwhelmed by Ahrefs or SEMrush, this is for you. If you're building a product and need "good enough" SEO without becoming an expert, this is for you.


PRICING & LAUNCH OFFER

🎉 Early adopters: $59/month (normally $99)
