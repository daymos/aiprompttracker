It's conversational. Ask "What keywords should I target?" and get search volume, competition, and suggestions instantly. "Check my rankings for X." See your position and competitors. Simple questions, instant answers.

$59/month. Real SEO data. Actually simple.


ALTERNATE VERSION (More Personal)
----------------------------------

Keywords.chat is the SEO tool I built for myself as an indie hacker.

Most SEO tools feel like piloting a spaceship. Fifty features, complex dashboards, hours of tutorials. I just wanted to know what keywords to target and if I was ranking. Simple stuff that shouldn't be complicated.

So I built this: 5 core fundamentals (keyword research, rank tracking, SERP analysis, site audits, backlinks) delivered through simple conversation. Ask "What keywords should I target for my SaaS?" and get everything you need in plain English. No menus. No learning curve.

It's for indie hackers building one thing, not agencies managing a hundred. You get the essentials that actually move the needle, nothing you'll never use. SEO research you can do while drinking coffee.

$59/month. Simple, fast, actually usable.
