Introduction
My name is Shaun Anderson, known online as @Hobo_Web. I have been a specialist
SEO consultant since 2006, and worked online as a website designer and developer
since the early 2000s.

This book is the 8th in a series (the first published in 2009) on SEO strategy.

My previous 2018 edition was a meandering guide to SEO for beginners; this 2025
book is an update to that. See other books in the series.

Following the landmark U.S. v. Google antitrust case disclosures, and the Content
Warehouse leak in early 2024, the foundational rules of search have been rewritten.
Long speculated ranking factors have been all but confirmed.

This book is a beginners’ guide to modern SEO for those who want to
understand and master this new reality.

My analysis is grounded in primary source evidence: sworn testimony from the DOJ
trial, Google's own patents, official documentation, exploits and recent data leaks.

We will move beyond common knowledge and deconstruct the systems that truly
define search ranking in 2025.

The goal is to provide a durable, evidence-based framework for making high-stakes
strategic decisions. See my AI policy. Disclosure: Affiliate links are clearly marked.

Let's begin.
