Chapter 1: How Google Really Works (A Beginner's Guide)




Welcome to Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)!

Getting your website to rank on Google can seem like a complex mystery, but it doesn't have
to be.

This beginners’ guide is built on research from my pro-SEO book called "Strategic SEO 2025,"
which analyzed internal Google information from the recent DOJ v Google court case and
2024 data leaks and exploits to reveal how Google search really works today.

We're going to pull back the curtain and explain Google's systems simply, starting with the big
ideas and then showing you the real terms for them.
