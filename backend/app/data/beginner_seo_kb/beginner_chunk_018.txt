How We Learned These Secrets: The U.S. vs. Google Trial
For a long time, the inner workings of Google's search engine were a closely guarded secret.
That all changed with a landmark antitrust trial, United States et al. v. Google LLC.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Google of creating an illegal monopoly.




To defend itself, Google's primary argument was that its search engine isn't dominant
because of illegal deals, but because it is simply a "superior product" that people choose to
use.

This defense created a strategic paradox: to prove its product was superior, Google was
legally "forced to compromise its most valuable intellectual property" by putting its top
engineers on the witness stand.

Under oath, they had to explain the very systems that make Google's search so
effective, providing an unprecedented and official blueprint of how ranking really works.
