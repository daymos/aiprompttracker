Chapter 2: The Importance of "Helpfulness"
In the last chapter, we learned about the technical systems Google uses to rank websites.
Now, we're going to focus on a single concept that has become one of the most important
ideas in modern SEO: Helpfulness.

Understanding this is critical because Google has started a war on what it calls "search
engine-first content," and the results have been devastating for many websites.

The Big Shift: "People-First" vs. "Search Engine-First"
For a long time, many websites were successful by creating content designed primarily to rank
high on Google rather than to genuinely help readers.

We've all seen these pages - they are often stuffed with keywords and generic fluff that leave
you feeling unsatisfied. This is what Google calls "search engine-first" content.

In response, Google has made a major shift to reward what it calls "people-first" content -
material created with the audience's needs and a satisfying experience in mind.

The Helpful Content Update (HCU)
To enforce this new standard, Google launched the Helpful Content Update (HCU) in August
2022.

This was one of the most significant algorithm changes in a decade, and its purpose was to
"make sure that unoriginal, low-quality content doesn’t rank highly in Search".

Here’s what a beginner needs to know about it:
 ●​ It's a Site-Wide Signal: This is the most important and dangerous aspect of the HCU. If
    Google determines that a website has a high amount of unhelpful content, it applies a
    negative signal to the entire site. This means your good, helpful pages can be dragged
    down by your low-quality pages.
 ●​ It's Now Part of the Core Algorithm: The HCU is no longer a separate, occasional
    update. As of March 2024, it has been integrated into Google's core ranking algorithm,
    meaning it's always on and continuously evaluating sites.
 ●​ Recovery is Extremely Difficult: The document makes it clear that recovering from an
    HCU penalty is a "Hard Road to Recovery (Or None at All)". Google's own advice to some
    affected site owners has been blunt: "If you were hit by HCU do not expect a recovery
    anytime soon. Move on".




Google's Own Checklist for Helpfulness
To help creators understand what "people-first" means, Google has provided a checklist of
questions to ask yourself about your content. According to the document, these questions get
to the heart of who created the content, how it was made, and why it exists.

Questions about "Who" and "How" (Your Expertise and Process)


 ●​ "Does your content clearly demonstrate first-hand expertise and a depth of knowledge
    (for example, expertise that comes from having actually used a product or service, or
    visiting a place)?"1​

 ●​ "Does your site have a primary purpose or focus?"2​

 ●​ "3Something that helps people intuitively understand the E-E-A-T of content is when it’s
    clear who created it… We strongly encourage adding accurate authorship information."​

 ●​ "Does the content present information in a way that makes you want to trust it, such as
    clear sourcing, evidence of the expertise involved, [and] background about the author or
    the site…?"

Questions about "Why" (Your Motivation)


 ●​ "Is the content primarily made to attract people from search engines?"
 ●​ "Are you producing lots of content on different topics in hopes that some of it might
    perform well in search results?"
 ●​ "Did you decide to enter some niche topic area without any real expertise, but instead
    mainly because you thought you'd get search traffic?"

Answering "yes" to these last three questions is a strong sign that you're creating "search
engine-first" content, which is precisely what the HCU is designed to demote.

How Google Measures Helpfulness and Trust
Google's idea of "helpful" is directly tied to its quality guidelines, known as E-E-A-T
(Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). In this framework, Trust is the
most important member of the family. You cannot have helpful content if your site is not
trustworthy.

While E-E-A-T involves many on-page factors, the book highlights a key insight into how
Google's systems algorithmically measure these concepts. It includes a report from Marie
Haynes regarding a conversation with Gary Illyes from Google. According to her, he stated
that E-A-T is "largely based on links and mentions on authoritative sites." The example
given was that if a major, trusted publication like the Washington Post mentions you, that's a
powerful signal of your authority and trustworthiness.

The Disconnected Entity Hypothesis




In the book I proposed the "Disconnected Entity Hypothesis" to explain why many sites
were hit by the HCU.
In simple terms, it suggests that Google penalizes websites that are not clearly connected to a
real, verifiable person or organization.
 ●​ What it means for you: If Google can't figure out who is responsible for your website,
    it's less likely to trust it. A site with no "About Us" page, no author information, or no clear
    contact details is a "Disconnected Entity" and, by definition, is likely to be classified as
    unhelpful content.
