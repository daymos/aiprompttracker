Action Plan: How to Create Helpful, People-First Content
To succeed in the era of the HCU, you must prove your content is helpful and trustworthy.

1. Be Transparent
Clearly state who owns and operates your website on an "About Us" page. Add author names
and bios to your articles to show who is responsible for the content. This directly fights the
"Disconnected Entity" problem.​

2. Publish Clear Policies and Disclosures
Trust isn't just about your main content; it's also about being upfront with your users about
how your site operates. Having clear policies is a strong trust signal.
 ●​ Website & Privacy Policies: Have a Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions page.
     The book notes that beyond being a legal requirement, this "shows transparency about
     user rights". The Hobo E-E-A-T tool was designed to aid in this purpose.
 ●​ Editorial Policy: Create an Editorial Policy that explains your content standards and
     how you ensure accuracy. The document advises that showing your "editorial oversight"
     is ideal for building trust.
 ●​ AI & Content Creation: Be transparent about how your content is created. If you use
     AI, explaining your process in an AI policy aligns with Google's advice to share "how a
     piece of a content was produced".
 ●​ Relevant Disclosures: Your site needs "clear info about any affiliate links or sponsored
     content" to be considered trustworthy.

3. Demonstrate First-Hand Experience
The HCU rewards content that clearly demonstrates expertise and real-world experience.
Write about what you actually know. If you're reviewing a product, show that you've used it. If
you're giving advice, show your credentials.​

4. Focus on Your Niche
Avoid writing about a little bit of everything just to chase trends. Stick to the core topics where
you are a genuine expert. This helps Google see you as an authority.​

5. Prune Unhelpful Content
Audit your website and remove or significantly improve any low-quality, thin, or redundant
pages. Remember, under the HCU, these unhelpful pages can negatively impact your entire
site's rankings.

6. Answer "Yes" to Google's Key Question
The ultimate test of helpfulness is in Google's own guidance: "Will someone reading your
content leave feeling like they’ve had a satisfying experience?".

If you focus on this with every page you create, you will be aligning your site with the core
goal of the Helpful Content system.
