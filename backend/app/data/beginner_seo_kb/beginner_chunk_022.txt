Chapter 3: Keyword Research and Content Strategy:
Answering the Right Questions
In the first two chapters, we pulled back the curtain on how Google's systems work and
established that the most important goal is to create helpful, people-first content. We know
Google is at war with "search engine-first content" and rewards sites that demonstrate real
expertise and deliver a satisfying user experience.

This leads to the next logical question: How do you figure out what to write about in the
first place?

This is where keyword research and content strategy come in. But we're going to forget the
old-school method of just finding popular words and stuffing them into a page.

In 2025, a modern strategy is about understanding the person behind the search and
answering their questions so effectively that they have no need to "pogo-stick" back to the
search results.

The Big Shift: From Keywords to Intent
For years, SEO was treated like a word-matching game. The goal was to find a keyword with
high search volume and repeat it on a page.

The HCU has made this approach obsolete and dangerous. Today, the key is to understand
user intent - the why behind a search query.

Matching your content to the user's intent is the first step to earning those "good clicks" that
power the Navboost system and signal to Google that your page is a valuable result. For
beginners, we can simplify intent into three main categories:
 ●​ Informational ("Know"): The user wants to learn something. These are often "who,"
    "what," "why," or "how" questions. Example: "how to create helpful content for seo".
 ●​ Navigational ("Go"): The user is trying to get to a specific website or brand they already
    know. Example: "hobo web seo book". This is the ultimate goal, as branded searches are
    a powerful signal that directly improves your Quality Score (Q∗).
 ●​ Transactional ("Do"): The user wants to take a specific action, like buying a product or
    signing up for a service. Example: "buy beginner seo 2025".

Before you create any piece of content, your first job is to identify the intent you are trying to
serve.

Your Modern Keyword Research Toolkit
You don't need expensive tools to get started. The best place to find out what people want is
the one you're trying to rank on: Google itself.
 ●​ Google Autocomplete: As you start typing in the search bar, Google suggests popular
    queries. This is a live look at what people are searching for right now.
 ●​ "People Also Ask" (PAA): This box, which appears in the middle of the search results, is
    a goldmine. It shows you the direct questions users have related to your topic. Answering
    these questions is a straightforward way to create helpful content.
 ●​ Related Searches: At the very bottom of the results page, Google shows you a list of
    other queries related to your original search. This helps you understand the different
    ways people think about a topic.

Leveling Up: Using a Professional Tool like Semrush
While the free tools are all you need to get started, if you're ready to speed up the process
and gather more data, a professional tool can be a powerful ally.

Semrush (I am an affiliate) is an industry-standard suite of tools that can help you apply our
"people-first" principles at scale.

Here's how a beginner can use it effectively:
 1.​ Finding Questions at Scale: The Keyword Magic Tool is the perfect step up from
     looking at the "People Also Ask" box. You can enter a broad topic (like "beginner SEO")
     and then simply click the "Questions" filter. This will instantly show you hundreds or
     thousands of questions people are searching for, which you can then sort and analyse to
     find topics that fit your expertise.
 2.​ Mapping Out Your Expertise: The Topic Research Tool is excellent for planning. It
     helps you visualize an entire subject area, showing you related subtopics, common
     headlines, and the questions people are asking. This is invaluable when building out topic
     clusters and proving to Google that you are an authority on your core niche.
 3.​ A Note on Competition: Semrush provides a "Keyword Difficulty" (KD%) score to
     estimate how hard it will be to rank for a term. A word of caution for beginners: Do not
     fall into the trap of only chasing "low competition" keywords. Remember the HCU's
     purpose is to demote content created without real expertise. A low KD% for a topic you
     know nothing about is a trap. Your first filter should always be the Expertise Check
     mentioned below. Use the KD% metric as a way to prioritize among the topics you are
     already an expert in.

How to Choose the Right Topics for Your Website
Finding a popular question isn't enough. The HCU penalizes sites that "enter some niche topic
area without any real expertise... mainly because you thought you'd get search traffic".

To stay safe and successful, run every potential content idea through this simple checklist,
which is based directly on Google's new standards:
 1.​ The Helpfulness Check: Is my primary motivation to help the reader, or is it "primarily
     made to attract people from search engines?". Can I create a page that will leave
     someone feeling they've had a truly "satisfying experience?".
 2.​ The Expertise Check: Does this topic align with my site's "primary purpose or focus?".
     Can I "clearly demonstrate first-hand expertise and a depth of knowledge" on this
     subject?. If not, skip it. Chasing trends outside your niche is exactly what Google wants to
     demote.
 3.​ The Intent Check: What does the user who searches this phrase really want to
     accomplish? Does my planned content directly meet that need, or am I trying to force my
     product or service onto someone who is just looking for information?
 4.​ The Competition Check: Look at the top results. Are they all massive, globally
     recognized brands? If so, you may struggle to compete. Look for a more specific,
     long-tail question where your deep, first-hand expertise can outshine a generic article
     from a big publisher.

Chapter 3 Action Plan
Modern keyword research is less about spreadsheets and more about empathy. It's about
understanding what people need and using your unique expertise to help them.
 1.​ Define Your Core Niche: Pick the single main topic where you are a genuine expert and
     where your site has a "primary purpose or focus".
 2.​ Find the Questions: Use the tools mentioned above to brainstorm a list of 10-15 real
     questions that people are asking about your niche.
 3.​ Validate with the Checklist: Run each of those questions through the 4-point checklist.
     Be honest with yourself. Ditch any topics that don't pass.
 4.​ Start Writing: Choose the most specific question you are most qualified to answer and
     start creating your first piece of truly helpful, people-first content.
