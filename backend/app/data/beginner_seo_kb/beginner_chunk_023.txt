Chapter 4: On-Page SEO: Optimising for People and
Clicks
In the last chapter, we created a plan. You've used modern research methods to find a
question your audience is asking—one that perfectly aligns with your unique, first-hand
expertise. You know what you're going to write about.

Now, we need to build the page itself.

This is On-Page SEO. It's the art and science of structuring your content in a way that is
perfectly clear to both human readers and Google's systems. The goal isn't to use tricks to
fool Google. The goal is to create such a clear and satisfying experience for the user that they
send all the right signals to Google for you. When you optimise for people, you are
optimising for Google.

The "Body" Signal: What Google Actually Reads
Let's go back to the "ABC" signals we learned about in Chapter 1. On-Page SEO is all about
the "B is for Body" signal—the actual words, titles, and headings in your page's content. The
quality of this signal is a direct ingredient in your website's overall Reputation or Quality Score
(Q∗).

For a beginner, there are three key elements to get right:
 1.​ The Page Title: This is the single most important headline. It serves two jobs: it tells
     Google the page's primary topic, and, more importantly, it appears in the search results
     and must convince the user to click on your page instead of someone else's. It should be
     clear, accurate, and compelling.
 2.​ Headings (H1, H2, H3): Think of headings as the outline for your page. Your main title on
     the page should be an H1. Major sections should be H2s, and any sub-sections within
     those should be H3s. This structure isn't just for looks; it allows users to scan your
     content easily to find what they need, and it helps Google understand the hierarchy and
     topics covered in your content.
 3.​ The Content Itself: This is the heart of the "Body" signal. Everything from Chapter 2
     applies here. Your writing must be helpful, demonstrate your expertise, and be created
     with the reader's best interest in mind.

Earning the "Last Longest Click"
Remember Navboost from Chapter 1? It's the powerful system that analyses 13 months of user
click data to re-rank results. Your primary goal with On-Page SEO is to earn what Google calls
the "last longest click". This is the ultimate signal of success: a user clicks your result, stays
on your page, and doesn't return to the search results because their question has been fully
answered.

Here’s how to structure your page to earn that click:
 ●​ Answer the Question Immediately: Don't hide your main point at the bottom of the
    page. Put the most important information and the direct answer to the user's query right
    at the top. This immediately signals to the user that they've come to the right place,
    preventing a "bad click".
 ●​ Make It Scannable: Very few people read web pages word-for-word. They scan. Use
    short paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for key ideas, and plenty of white space. The
    easier you make it for a user to scan and absorb your information, the longer they will
    stay engaged.
 ●​ Use Helpful Media: A relevant image, a helpful diagram, or an embedded video can
    often explain a concept better than hundreds of words. This breaks up the text and
    increases the time users spend on your page, reinforcing the "longest click" signal.
 ●​ Guide Them to What's Next: A successful page shouldn't be a dead end. Use internal
    links to guide your reader to other relevant, helpful articles on your site. This provides a
    better user experience and helps demonstrate your site's authority on the topic.

Chapter 4 Action Plan
Use this simple, five-point checklist every time you publish a new page to ensure you're
optimising for both people and clicks.
 1.​ Craft a Compelling Title: Does my page title accurately describe the content and make
     a user want to click on it in the search results?
 2.​ Create a Clear Outline: Have I used H2 and H3 headings to break the content into
     logical, scannable sections?
 3.​ Put the Answer First: Is the most important takeaway or the direct answer to the user's
     question visible at the top of the page?
 4.​ Review for Readability: Is the page easy to scan? Have I used short paragraphs, bullet
     points, and bolding to make the content digestible?
 5.​ Write for Humans: Have I written naturally and avoided repeating keywords in a way that
     sounds robotic? Does the page offer genuine value and expertise?
