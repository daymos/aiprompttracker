Chapter 5: Building Your Reputation: Earning Links and
Authority Signals
So far, we have a solid plan. You've chosen an expert topic, created a helpful piece of content,
and optimised it so people can easily read and understand it.

But here’s a critical question: If a million people write about the same topic, how does Google
decide which page is the most trustworthy?

The answer lies outside of your own website. Google looks for signals of trust from across the
web. The most powerful signals are links and mentions from other reputable websites.

This chapter is about how to earn those signals, which are the primary ingredients for building
your site’s overall Reputation (Q∗) score.

Why Links Still Matter More Than Ever
For as long as Google has existed, links have been fundamental to how it works. Think of a link
as a vote of confidence from one site to another.

This concept is powered by a foundational system called PageRank. But not all votes are
equal. A link from a major, trusted source like the BBC or an academic journal is an incredibly
powerful endorsement. A link from a brand-new, unknown blog is worth very little.

This is because Google organises its index into different quality levels or "tiers". A link from a
site in a "higher-quality tier" carries significantly more weight and passes more trust to your
website.

This is how Google algorithmically measures concepts like E-A-T (Experience, Expertise,
Authoritativeness, Trust). As the book highlights, Google's own engineers have confirmed that
E-A-T is "largely based on links and mentions on authoritative sites".

The Anatomy of a Good Link
When another site links to you, it creates a powerful signal. Let's break down the most
important part of that signal, which we first met in Chapter 1.

It's the "A is for Anchors" signal. The anchor text is the visible, clickable text in a link. It gives
Google a valuable clue about the topic of the page being linked to.


For example, anchor text like:
 ●​ "Read our comprehensive guide to caring for houseplants"​
    ...is much more descriptive and helpful to Google than generic text like:
 ●​ "Click here to read more"

A truly valuable link has two key qualities:
 1.​ Relevance: It comes from a website or page that is topically related to yours. A link from
     another SEO blog to this book is a highly relevant signal.
 2.​ Authority: It comes from a website that is already trusted by Google and sits in a
     high-quality tier of its index.



How to Earn Links (The People-First Way)
Forget about trying to trick Google. Modern, sustainable link building is about link earning.
It’s about creating assets so valuable that other people in your field want to link to them.
 ●​ Create Link-Worthy Content: This is the foundation. You cannot earn links to average
    content. Focus on creating things that are genuinely exceptional. This could be a unique
    study with original data, the most complete guide on a niche topic, a free tool or
    calculator, or a compelling case study.
 ●​ Be a Source for Others: One of the best ways to build authority is to share your
    expertise. You can use services that connect journalists with experts for quotes. When a
    journalist uses your quote in an article, they will often credit you with a mention and a link
    back to your website. This is a powerful E-A-T signal.
 ●​ Strategic Outreach: Once you have a truly great piece of content, you need to let the
    right people know it exists. This involves identifying bloggers, journalists, or site
    managers in your niche and sending them a short, personal email. The goal is not to beg
    for a link, but to show them a resource you've created that could be genuinely valuable to
    their audience.

Chapter 5 Action Plan
Your first steps in building your site's reputation don't need to be complicated. The focus
should always be on quality over quantity.
 1.​ Identify Your Best Asset: Review the content you have created. Which page is the most
     helpful, unique, or comprehensive? This is the page you should focus on first.
 2.​ Find 5 Potential "Linkers": Use Google to find five other websites or blogs that write
     about your topic. Look for resource pages or articles where they already link out to other
     helpful guides.
 3.​ Focus on Value: Before you do anything else, ask yourself: "Is my page genuinely more
     helpful or valuable than the resources they currently link to?" If not, improve your page
     first.
 4.​ Start Small: Pick one site from your list and send a short, polite email. Introduce your
     resource and briefly explain why it might be a good fit for their audience. Don't expect a
     reply, but this is how the process begins. One good link is worth more than a hundred
     bad ones.
