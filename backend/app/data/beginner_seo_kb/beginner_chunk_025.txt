Chapter 6: Essential Technical SEO: A Beginner's Checklist
The phrase "technical SEO" can sound intimidating. It brings to mind images of code, servers,
and complex spreadsheets. But for a beginner, the reality is much simpler.

You've created helpful content that demonstrates your expertise. You've structured it
perfectly on the page and started earning signals of authority from other sites. The final piece
of the puzzle is to ensure there are no technical roadblocks preventing Google from finding,
understanding, and showing your pages to users.

Think of it like this: you've built a brilliant shop with fantastic products. Technical SEO is simply
making sure the front door is unlocked, the lights are on, and the aisles are clear for both your
customers and the search engines that list you.

Making Your Site Easy for Google to Read
Before Google can rank your content, it must first discover it (crawling) and store it in its
massive database (indexing). Your job is to make this process as efficient as possible.
 ●​ A Logical Site Structure: A well-organised website is easier for both users and search
    engines to navigate. The "Topic Cluster" model we discussed in Chapter 3, with a main
    "pillar" page and several supporting "cluster" pages, is a perfect example. A clear
    navigation menu and internal links between related articles help Google understand the
    relationships between your pages and which ones are most important.
 ●​ An XML Sitemap: This sounds technical, but it's just a list of all the important URLs on
    your site, formatted for search engines. It's like giving Google a map to ensure it doesn't
    miss any of your key pages. Thankfully, you don't need to create this by hand. Most
    modern website platforms and SEO plugins (like Yoast or Rank Math for WordPress) will
    automatically generate and update it for you.
 ●​ The Robots.txt File: This is a simple text file that gives search engines instructions about
    which parts of your site they shouldn't look at. For example, you might tell Google to
    ignore your admin login pages or a test area of your site. It's not about hiding content,
    but about helping Google use its resources more efficiently by focusing only on the
    pages you want it to index.

Optimising for the User's Experience
Many technical factors directly impact how a user experiences your website. A slow, clunky, or
frustrating site will lead to "bad clicks" and "pogo-sticking" - users immediately leaving your
site and returning to the search results. These are powerful negative signals for the Navboost
system.
 ●​ Site Speed: In our fast-paced world, speed is critical. If your page takes too long to load,
    users will abandon it. Google knows this, and its Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics
    designed to measure the real-world user experience of a page. For a beginner, you don't
    need to obsess over a perfect score. Focus on the basics: use a good quality web host
    and compress your images to reduce their file size before you upload them.
 ●​ Mobile-Friendliness: The majority of Google searches now happen on mobile phones.
    Because of this, Google uses the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking
    (this is called "mobile-first indexing"). Your website must look and work perfectly on a
    mobile device. Text should be easy to read without zooming, and buttons should be easy
    to tap. Most modern website themes are "responsive" (they adapt to different screen
    sizes) by default, but you should always check this yourself on your own phone.

Chapter 6 Action Plan
You don't need to be a developer to check the technical health of your site. Here is a simple,
non-technical checklist you can run through right now.
 1.​ Do the Mobile Test: Open your website on your phone. Is it easy to use? Can you read
     the text? Do the links work? Navigate to a few different pages.
 2.​ Run a Speed Check: Use a free tool like Google's PageSpeed Insights. Don't worry
     about understanding every detail. Just see if it flags your site as "slow" and look for any
     simple recommendations, like "serve images in next-gen formats" (which often means
     compressing them).
 3.​ Check for the Padlock: Look at your website's address in your browser. Does it begin
     with https:// and display a padlock icon? This means your site is secure (using HTTPS),
     which is a crucial trust signal for both users and Google.
 4.​ Review Your Navigation: Is it simple for a first-time visitor to find your most important
     pages (like your "About" or "Contact" pages) from your homepage? If it's easy for a
     human, it's likely easy for Google.
 5.​ Consider an SEO Plugin: If your site is built on WordPress, installing a well-regarded
     SEO plugin will handle many basic technical basics, like your XML sitemap, automatically.
