Chapter 7: Measuring What Matters: An Introduction to
SEO Analytics
You've done the hard work. You've created helpful, people-first content, structured it clearly,
made your site technically sound, and started building your reputation. But SEO is not a "set it
and forget it" activity.

The final, crucial step in the process is to measure your results.

Analytics help you understand what's working, what isn't, and where you should focus your
efforts next. But you don't need to be a data scientist to get valuable insights.

This chapter will introduce you to the two most important (and free) tools from Google and
focus on the handful of key metrics that truly matter for a beginner.

Google Search Console: Your Direct Line to Google
If you only use one tool, make it this one. Google Search Console (GSC) is how Google
communicates directly with you. It gives you data on how your site is performing in the search
results, alerts you to technical issues, and provides invaluable insights into how users are
finding you.

For a beginner, the "Performance" report is the most important area. Here are the key metrics
to watch:
 ●​ Clicks: The number of times a user has clicked through to your site from a Google search
    result. This is your actual SEO traffic.
 ●​ Impressions: The number of times a link to your site appeared in a search result. This
    shows your potential reach.
 ●​ Click-Through Rate (CTR): The percentage of impressions that resulted in a click (Clicks
    ÷ Impressions). A high CTR indicates that your page titles are compelling and relevant to
    what users are searching for, which is a positive signal.
 ●​ Average Position: The average ranking of your page for a specific search query.

A great way to use this report is to find pages with high impressions but a low CTR. This is
often an opportunity to simply rewrite the page title to be more engaging, which can result in
a quick traffic boost.

Google Analytics 4: Understanding Your Visitors
While Search Console tells you what happens in the search results, Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
tells you what happens on your website after a user clicks. It helps you understand your
audience and how they interact with your content.

Here are the key metrics to focus on in GA4:
 ●​ Users: The number of individual people who have visited your site. This helps you
    understand the size of your audience.
 ●​ Engaged sessions: A session is counted as "engaged" if the visitor stays for longer than
    10 seconds, has a key event, or visits more than one page. This metric helps you filter out
    people who leave your site immediately.
 ●​ Average engagement time: This shows how long, on average, your web page was the
    main focus in a user's browser. This is perhaps the best available proxy for the "last
    longest click" signal we discussed in Chapter 1. A high average engagement time is a
    strong sign that users are finding your content valuable and having a satisfying
    experience.

By looking at which pages have the highest average engagement time, you can learn what
type of content resonates most with your audience, so you can create more of it.

Chapter 7 Action Plan
Getting started with analytics is about building good habits, not drowning in data.
 1.​ Get Set Up: Your first step is to install Google Analytics 4 on your site and verify your
     ownership in Google Search Console. There are many simple, free guides online to walk
     you through this process for any website platform.
 2.​ Schedule a Monthly Check-in: You do not need to check your stats every day. This
     often leads to unnecessary worry. Set aside 30 minutes once a month to review your
     progress.
 3.​ Ask Two Key Questions: During your monthly check-in, focus on finding the answers to
     just two questions:
      ○​ "Which page on my site is proving to be the most helpful to my users?" (Look at
          Average engagement time in GA4).
      ○​ "Which page gives me the best opportunity for a quick win?" (Look for high
          impressions but low CTR in GSC).
 4.​ Track Your Brand: Once you have a few months of data, start comparing searches that
     include your brand name to those that don't. A steady increase in branded searches over
     time is the ultimate sign that you are achieving the most important goal in SEO: building a
     trusted and recognisable brand.
