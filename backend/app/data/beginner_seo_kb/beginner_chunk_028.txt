Chapter 9: Your First Step into Action: The Hobo Free
SEO Checklist




The journey into SEO can seem daunting. The frameworks in this collection provide the map,
but you still need a reliable compass to guide your first steps. This is why I've engineered the
Hobo Free SEO Checklist. This is your first tool for turning the foundational principles from
Beginner SEO 2025 into tangible, organized actions.

This is not just a list of tips; it is an operational template in Google Sheets, distilled from over
two decades of professional auditing experience.

It is designed to map out your initial SEO project and empower you to identify the very issues
that could be suppressing your site's performance, all anchored in Google's own webmaster
guidelines.

Core Modules of the Free Checklist

The free template is a multi-tabbed system that deconstructs a foundational SEO audit into a
series of clear, manageable modules.

Module 1: Foundational Health Audit
The audit begins with your site’s technical bedrock. Before you can win with content, you must
ensure your digital house is in order.
