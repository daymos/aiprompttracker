Introduction
My name is Shaun Anderson, known online as @Hobo_Web. I have been a specialist
SEO consultant since 2006, and worked online as a website designer and developer
since the early 2000s.

This book is the 6th (the first published in 2009) in a series on SEO strategy, but it
marks a significant departure from the past 5 books. This is a book of advanced SEO
concepts for professional SEOs.

The companion book to this book is Hobo: Beginner SEO 2025. That is for beginners;
this book is not. The third book in the trilogy is Hobo: Strategic AI SEO 2025 again, a
more advanced book.

Following the landmark U.S. v. Google antitrust case disclosures, and the Content
Warehouse leak in early 2024, the foundational rules of search have been rewritten.
Long speculated ranking factors have been all but confirmed.

This book is an advanced strategic playbook for the professional SEO who
needs to understand and master this new reality.

My analysis is grounded in primary source evidence: sworn testimony from the DOJ
trial, Google's own patents, official documentation, exploits and recent data leaks.

We will move beyond common knowledge and deconstruct the systems that truly
define search ranking in 2025.

The goal is to provide a durable, evidence-based framework for making high-stakes
strategic decisions. Listen to an audio overview of this book. See previous editions.

Let's begin.
