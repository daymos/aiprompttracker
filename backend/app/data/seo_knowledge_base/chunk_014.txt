Entity SEO: How to Get Your Business Recognised as an Entity by
Google
Over the last 20 years I’ve watched Google shift from merely matching keywords to
truly understanding who and what is behind the content.

This evolution - often summed up by Google’s move to “things, not strings”- means
that optimizing for entities is now essential, especially for small businesses.

What Are “Entities” in Google’s Eyes?

In Google’s terminology, an entity is essentially a uniquely identifiable “thing” or
concept - a person, place, organisation, idea, etc., as understood in Google’s
Knowledge Graph similarweb.com.

Google’s Knowledge Graph is a massive knowledge base of facts about the world,
which helps Google connect the dots between words and the real-world “things” they
represent.

As Google Fellow Amit Singhal described when introducing the Knowledge Graph, it
enables you to search for things (people, places, landmarks, businesses, etc.) that
Google knows about, and get relevant information instantly.

In plain terms, Google wants to know exactly who or what it’s dealing with when
ranking content.

From an SEO perspective, an entity isn’t just a keyword or phrase; it’s an actual
concept with a unique identity in a database.

Dixon Jones puts it nicely: “An entity is a concept in a database with an ID number…
something like the Eiffel Tower can be called ‘Eiffel Tower’ or ‘that big metal thing in
Paris’ in many languages, but they all refer to the same well-recognized entity”
20i.com.

In practice, this means Google can recognize your business (or any topic) as a distinct
entity if it finds enough information to confidently identify it in its Knowledge Graph or
other structured data sources.

Why Entity SEO Matters (Especially for Small Businesses)

Entity SEO is about making your business “known” to Google as a trustworthy,
authoritative entity.

This is crucial for earning Google’s trust.

If Google can’t determine that your website is backed by a real, reputable entity, you
risk being overlooked or filtered out.

In fact, I’ve proposed the “Disconnected Entity Hypothesis” to describe what happens
when a site lacks clear entity signals.


                                                          131

In short, sites without a robust, verifiable tie to a trusted real-world presence tend to
get shoved to the gutter of search results.

Google won’t outright call it that, but the pattern is clear: websites with “no face” - no
identifiable author, no company info, no external authority signals - struggle to rank.

Google is “hunting down entities it can’t vouch for”, as I have mentioned in my DEH.

On the flip side, if you establish your business as a known entity, Google is more
confident serving your content.

Google spokespersons have repeatedly emphasized the importance of expertise,
authority, and trust (E-E-A-T).

But those signals can only fully apply when Google understands who is providing the
content.

As Jason Barnard explains: “If Google understands who you are, then it can apply
[E-E-A-T] signals fully. If it has to guess who you are, then it can only apply them in a
dampened manner… So being in Google’s Knowledge Graph - meaning Google has
fully understood who you are - is crucial. Entity understanding and your identity in
Google’s mind is the single most important thing in SEO”.

In other words, your great content and links won’t count for nearly as much if Google
can’t tie them to a credible entity.

This is especially true after recent algorithm updates (e.g. Google’s Helpful Content
and spam updates) which appear to favor “entities [Google] can bank on - healthy
ones with a trail of trust” hobo-web.co.uk.

For small businesses, entity SEO can be a competitive equalizer. You might not
outspend big brands on ads or have the highest Domain Authority, but you can carve
out a clear identity in your niche.

By doing so, you signal to Google: “We are a real business with expertise in our area,
and here’s the proof.”

Let’s find out exactly how to do that.

Practical Steps to Implement Entity SEO for Your Business

Entity SEO may sound abstract, but it comes down to concrete steps and best
practices.

Below I outline how a small business can build its entity presence, with guidance from
Google and experienced SEOs.

Secure Your Business’s Presence in Authoritative Databases

To get recognized as an entity, your business needs to exist in the reference sources
that Google trusts. An expert tip is to go to the primary sources of information for
Google.

Google’s Knowledge Graph draws information from many places - including Wikidata,
Wikipedia, official databases, and high-authority websites searchenginejournal.com.

In a 2018 AMA, Google’s John Mueller confirmed “we use the Knowledge Graph
(which comes from various places, including Wikipedia) to try to understand entities
on a page.” searchenginejournal.com

This tells us that having a Wikipedia page greatly boosts entity recognition (though
Wikipedia has strict notability rules, so not every small business can get one).

If your business is notable enough, earning a Wikipedia entry or at least a mention on
Wikipedia will directly feed Google reliable info about your entity.

However, Wikipedia isn’t the only game in town. Wikidata (the structured database
behind Wikipedia) is another key source; a Wikidata item for your business can
sometimes lead to Knowledge Graph recognition. Other databases matter too. For
example, many companies (especially startups and local businesses) get listed on
Crunchbase, which provides structured profiles of organizations. As one guide notes,
registered businesses usually have a Crunchbase entity… linking to this in your
schema markup can help disambiguate your company inlinks.com and inlinks.com.
Even if Crunchbase isn’t as “powerful” as Wikipedia, it’s a verified source that can
reinforce your business details.

                                                     Strategic SEO 2025




Google Business Profile is another must for any local business. If you haven’t
already, claim your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) and fill it
out completely.

This effectively creates an entity entry for your business in Google’s local Knowledge
Graph.

As Dixon Jones emphasizes, “make sure you’re on Google My Business, [it’s]
especially important if you’re a local or regional business.”20i.com

A Google Business Profile listing ties your entity to a physical location, category,
hours, reviews, and more - all signals that you’re a legitimate “somebody” in Google’s
eyes, not a faceless website.

Other authoritative listings: Depending on your niche, seek inclusion in industry
databases, government registries, or respected directories.

For instance, a healthcare clinic might get listed on Healthgrades, or a software
company on G2 Crowd.

The goal is to create a footprint of facts about your business across the web: same
name, address, phone, description, and URL on all these sources.

Consistency is key - you want Google’s crawlers to find the same core information
everywhere, reinforcing the existence of one unambiguous entity (your business).

Designate an “Entity Home” on Your Website and Use Schema Markup

Your own website should clearly represent your business as an entity. Think of your
site (especially your homepage or an about page) as the Entity Home - the definitive
source about who you are.

Jason Barnard advises creating a dedicated page (often the About Us page) that
explicitly describes your organization or yourself, and then corroborating that
across the web - see thebrandserpguy.com.

I agree.


                                                             134

                                                  Strategic SEO 2025




In practice, on that page you should include factual details: founding date, founders
or key people, location, what you do, awards, etc.

Then, you’ll want to mark it up with structured data.

Use schema.org markup (JSON-LD format) to define your entity for search engines.

For a business, you’d typically use the Organization schema (or LocalBusiness
for local companies) with properties like name, logo, address, founding date, founder,
etc. A crucial property to add is sameAs - here you list URLs that represent the same
entity.

These can include your social media profiles, your Crunchbase page, your Wikipedia
page (if exists), Wikidata entry, Google Business Profile, or any other profile that
Google can reference.

By providing sameAs links, you’re basically telling Google “All these pages refer to the
same entity - me.”

This can greatly help Google reconcile your entity’s identity across its Knowledge
Graph and the web.

One thing to avoid: Don’t use Google’s internal Knowledge Graph IDs (the /g/ or /m/
codes) in your schema.

John Mueller has noted that while it’s technically possible to put a Knowledge Graph
ID as a sameAs URL, it’s not recommended seroundtable.com.

Stick to public URLs that are recognized as authoritative profiles.

After adding structured data, test it with Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema
Markup Validator to ensure it’s error-free.

While schema markup alone doesn’t guarantee a Knowledge Panel or ranking boost,
it’s an important puzzle piece. It provides machine-readable context about your entity
that can validate what Google finds elsewhere.

Build a Cohesive Topical Content Structure (Site-Wide Entity Optimisation)

Beyond official profiles and schema, your site’s content and structure need to
communicate your topic authority to Google.

Entity SEO isn’t just about metadata; it’s also about how you organize and interlink
your content so Google can see the breadth of knowledge you offer around your
niche.

Start with your site architecture. A logical, hierarchical site structure helps Google
understand the relationship between topics on your site.

In fact, Google’s John Mueller has implied that a well-structured site (with clear URL
hierarchy, breadcrumbs, and internal links) helps Google grasp how things are
connected on your site – see similarweb.com.

For example, if you run a travel blog, a structure like:

bash

CopyEdit

example.com/travel/                                    (general topic page)

example.com/travel/destinations/                                (subcategory)

example.com/travel/destinations/paris                                     (specific entity page)

example.com/travel/destinations/milan                                     (specific entity page)



tells Google that Paris and Milan are entities under the sub-topic “destinations,”
which falls under the broader topic “travel.”

A pyramid-like site architecture (homepage -> categories -> sub-categories -> pages)
isn’t just good for UX, it’s an SEO signal that your content is systematically covering a
topic area. By structuring content into silos or clusters, you essentially map an entity
hierarchy that mirrors real-world relationships.

Use internal linking generously and meaningfully to reinforce these relationships.

If you have a cornerstone page about “Home Security Systems,” and several blog
posts about related components (cameras, sensors, alarms), link them to the
cornerstone and to each other where relevant.

This network of contextual links essentially says to Google: “All of these pages are
about closely related entities/topics.” The easier you make it for Google to crawl your
whole content network and see the connections, the better it can assign you authority
for the overall subject matter.

Pro tip: Analyze how top competitors structure their sites in your vertical.

If the leading sites in your niche all have sections for certain subtopics, that’s a clue to
what Google expects to see as part of the topic cluster.

You don’t need to copy their navigation exactly, but knowing the common content
segments can guide your own site structure decisions - see.

Optimise On-Page Content with Entities in Mind (Semantic SEO)

Entity SEO also transforms how you approach on-page optimization.

Instead of obsessing over one keyword per page, think in terms of covering a topic
comprehensively and semantically (as I advised in my 2018 ebook).

Here are practical on-page tactics for entity optimization:

   ●​ Use Semantic HTML Structure: Organize your headings (H1, H2, H3…) to
       reflect a logical breakdown of the topic. Your H1 should clearly state the page’s
       primary topic (the main entity or concept). Then use H2s for major subtopics or
       aspects, and H3s for details under those subtopics. This not only helps readers
       but also signals to Google the hierarchy of concepts on the page
       similarweb.com and similarweb.com. For example, if your page is about
       “Healthy Eating Habits” (primary entity), an H2 might be “Foundation of a
       Balanced Diet,” with H3s under it like “Role of Macronutrients” and “Essential
       Micronutrients”similarweb.com. This kind of semantic structuring reinforces the
       context of each section. Pro Tip - Optimise your Headings 2-6 for the USER ON
                                                          137

   THE PAGE not necessary for Search Engines.​

●​ Cover Related Entities and Contextual Terms: Google’s understanding of a
   page comes from the network of entities mentioned in the text. Ask yourself:
   what related people/places/things would naturally be mentioned when
   discussing this topic? If you have a page about “Bruce Lee,” it’s logical to
   mention “Jeet Kune Do” (the martial art he created) and maybe related figures
   like “Ip Man” or “Chuck Norris.” In fact, if none of those appear, your content
   might be seen as oddly shallow or off-topic. Google’s analysis (with NLP
   algorithms) will look for these semantically connected terms. A quick trick is the
   “People Also Ask” or related searches: these often hint at entities tied to your
   topic. Another is using Google’s Natural Language API demo on a high-ranking
   article in your topic to see what entities Google extracts - this can reveal which
   terms Google strongly associates with the topic.​

●​ Answer User Intents Directly: Because Google’s stated goal is to satisfy
   search intent, make sure your content addresses common questions head-on.
   Often, this means providing a concise answer or definition at the top of your
   page (which can even land you a featured snippet). From an entity standpoint,
   directly defining or explaining the entity early on gives Google a clear signal of
   relevance. For instance, if the page is “What is Entity SEO?”, start by literally
   defining it. This aligns with semantic search principles - you’re matching the
   meaning of the query, not just repeating the query words. It’s good for users
   and for search engines’ understanding. Think DISTANCE “from”.. Distance from
   the TITLE to THE TEXT or from the TITLE to a TABLE.​

●​ Avoid “Keyword Stuffing”; Aim for Meaningful Coverage: In the old days,
   one might just repeat a keyword to death. Now, it’s about coverage of
   concepts. If you write naturally and thoroughly on a subject, you’ll include many
   related entities and phrases without forcing it. One clever exercise (credited to
   Laurent Bourelly) is the “mystery word game”: write a paragraph about your
   topic without naming it explicitly - if it’s still obvious what you’re talking about,
   you’ve included enough relevant context words. This helps ensure you’re not
   relying on one keyword, but truly describing the entity and its connections.​

In short, think of each page as building Google’s confidence in your knowledge of the
topic.

The more clearly Google can see which entities your content is about and how they
relate, the more likely it is to deem your page a good answer for relevant queries.

Highlight Authors and Build E-E-A-T Signals Around Your Entity

Google’s focus on entities isn’t just about companies or products - it also extends to
people (like the authors who write your content or the professionals at your
business).

For a small business, this means you should feature real, credentialed people and link
their identities to your brand.

Make sure articles and blog posts on your site have author names (and ideally brief
bios) attached.

If Jane Doe writes an article, have an author page for Jane that describes her
credentials (and mark it up with Person schema).

Google has what’s called an “author entity” for prominent writers and a “publisher
entity” for websites jasonbarnard.com.

You want to feed the right information to those. The more Google can identify “Oh,
this article on example.com was written by Dr. Jane Doe, who also is listed as a
medical expert on HealthSite.org,” the more it can trust the content.

While as a small business you might not have famous authors, you can still establish
your team’s expertise.

Link to their LinkedIn profiles, mention awards or certifications - anything that would
exist in the Knowledge Graph or at least signal REAL credibility.

Likewise, be transparent about your business on your site.

Have a robust About page (as discussed) and show trust factors: physical address,
photos of your team or premises, membership in professional associations, etc.
                                                         139

All these contribute to your entity’s trustworthiness.

Google’s own quality rater guidelines (used internally to train algorithms) place huge
importance on E-E-A-T for content creators and websites.

By demonstrating Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust, you are essentially
saying “We are a legitimate, experienced entity in our field.”

Remember, as Jason states “Google is a child that wants to learn, and we need to
educate it” about who we are.

So don’t be shy - spell it out. If you’re a licensed contractor with 10 years in business,
say so.

If your CEO has a PhD in the topic you’re covering, make that known.

Think of every detail as another reference point for Google’s entity understanding.

Maintain Consistency and Corroborate Information Across the Web

Finally, Entity SEO isn’t a set-and-forget deal. You need to maintain consistency of
your business information and continually seek corroboration.

Ensure that whenever your business is mentioned elsewhere (news articles,
directories, guest posts, etc.), the facts match what’s on your site. Inconsistent NAP
(Name, Address, Phone) data, for instance, can confuse Google’s local entity
resolution.

Use a service or manually keep track of all your listings and correct any discrepancies.

It also pays to monitor your presence in Google’s Knowledge Graph. You can use
Google’s Knowledge Graph API to query if your entity is recognized (it will return an ID
and some info if found).

Set up Google Alerts for your brand name or key people to catch new mentions -
those might be opportunities to build more entity signals (for example, if a local
newspaper mentions your business, make sure they included a link or at least the
correct name - if not, you might reach out to fix any errors).

                                                         140

If you start to see a Knowledge Panel appear for your business on Google searches
(that box with facts on the right side), that’s a great sign - it means Google has
assembled an entity profile for you.

At that point, claim the knowledge panel (there’s a “Claim this knowledge panel”
option) by verifying through your official accounts.

Once claimed, you can suggest edits to it and further ensure accuracy.

Leverage Entity-Oriented SEO Tools (Optional, Advanced)

As a bonus step, consider using tools that specialize in entity SEO to refine your
strategy. For example, InLinks (which Dixon Jones co-founded) can analyze your
content and suggest internal links and schema based on entity detection.

There are also tools to visualize knowledge graphs of your site or to find entity gaps in
your content.

While you can absolutely do Entity SEO manually, these tools can provide
guidance - think of them as training wheels that use NLP APIs and knowledge bases
to make recommendations (like telling you that top-ranking pages about “DIY home
security” all mention a certain concept that you omitted).

Whether or not you use specialized software, the fundamental strategy remains: treat
your website not just as a collection of pages, but as an interconnected web of
known entities and topics.

You’re effectively teaching Google how all the pieces fit together, and why your
business is a trusted authority in your domain.
