# Building Trust and Recovering from Trust Deficits

Building Trust and Recovering from Trust Deficits
Bringing it all together, here is a checklist of practical steps:

   1.​ Clearly Identify Your Website’s Owner and Purpose: Create a
       comprehensive “About Us” page that states who runs the site (individual
       person, team, or company). Include the business name and any legal entity
       information if applicable (e.g. LLC name, registration number for companies).
       Explain your site’s mission or purpose so users (and Google) understand why it
       exists. This directly addresses QRG Section 2.5.2 by showing who is
       responsible: hobo-web.co.uk. Action: For example, list your company’s full
       name and address, or if you’re a solo blogger, share a bit about yourself and
       your credentials. Hobo Web advises that publishing your “full company name,
       legal registration info, and editorial oversight” is ideal hobo-web.co.uk.​

   2.​ Provide Author By-lines and Bios: Every piece of content that has a
       discernible author should list one. Add by-lines to articles or posts, and link
       each by-line to a dedicated author page or bio section. On the author page,
       include the author’s background, qualifications or experience in the topic, and
       other publications if relevant. Google explicitly “strongly encourages adding
       accurate authorship information” on contenthobo-web.co.uk and
       developers.google.com. This helps satisfy the “Who created the content”
       aspect of E-E-A-T. Action: Even if the “author” is the site name (e.g. a news
       site’s staff), you can state content is produced by the “So-and-so Editorial
       Team” and describe that team. The key is no content should appear
       anonymous - lack of authorship is a trust killer (“Lack of authorship
       transparency is considered unhelpful” in Google’s own words hobo-web.co.uk).​

3.​ Show Contact and Customer Support Info: Make it easy for users to contact
    you or get help. At minimum, have a Contact page with a contact form or email
    address. If you are a business, provide a phone number and physical address. If
    you offer products or services, list customer service channels or hours.
    Google’s guidelines associate robust contact info with higher trust (and lack
    thereof with lowest quality) hobo-web.co.uk. Particularly for online stores or
    financial services, users expect to see real-world contact details - it signals
    that there are real people behind the site who will be accountable. Action:
    Ensure your site’s footer or menu prominently links to contact information.
    Respond promptly and helpfully to inquiries - while this is a user experience
    issue, positive interactions can lead to good reviews, bolstering your reputation.​

4.​ Implement Structured Data for Organization/Person: Help Google connect
    the dots about your entity by using schema markup. For example, use
    Organization schema on your About page to provide your company’s details
    (name, logo, address, founders), or Person schema for individual authors
    (name, title, sameAs links to social profiles or Wikipedia, etc.). Shaun Anderson
    notes that structured data “ties it all together” for section 2.5.2 compliance.
    While schema markup itself isn’t a ranking factor, it can feed Google’s
    Knowledge Graph and improve how your entity is recognized. Action: Add
   <script type="application/ld+json"> JSON-LD markup on pages to
   define the organization and author entities. Also link out to official profiles
   (LinkedIn, official social media, professional associations) - these sameAs links
   can reinforce that your entity is real and has external corroboration.​

5.​ Demonstrate Experience and Expertise in Content: This addresses the
    “Experience” and “Expertise” parts of E-E-A-T which support trust. Ensure
    your content showcases first-hand experience where appropriate. For instance,
    if you have a product review, mention that you tested the product and include
    original photos or data - Google says “it can build trust with readers” when
    they see evidence of hands-on experience developers.google.com. If you
    discuss a YMYL topic, consider having an expert review the content (and
    mention that fact). Always strive for factual accuracy and cite sources for
                                                      143

   important facts or statistics. Not only will this satisfy users, it aligns with
   Google’s helpful content criteria (e.g., “Does your content clearly demonstrate
   first-hand expertise…?”developers.google.com). Action: Add a “References”
   or “Sources” list if applicable, or inline citations for studies and authoritative
   references. Regularly update content that could go out-of-date, especially on
   YMYL topics, to maintain accuracy. Speak in 1st person for Experience and 2nd
   person when speaking to the user (another recommendation from Google’s
   style guide - internal documents).​

6.​ Boost Your External Reputation (Earn Mentions and Reviews): While you
    can’t directly control what others say, you can encourage positive buzz. If you
    are a business, claim your profiles on review platforms (Google, Yelp,
    industry-specific sites) and encourage happy customers to leave reviews. If you
    produce great content, do outreach for backlinks or mentions from respected
    sites in your niche - not for “link juice” per se, but to get your name out there
    as a trusted source. Google’s raters will check for external signals
    vertical-leap.uk, and likely the algorithm does something similar (evaluating
    mentions or links from authoritative sources as a sign of credibility). Action:
    Feature testimonials or case studies on your site; these might get picked up by
    others. Engage in your community (forums, Q&A sites, social media) under your
    real name or brand to build a positive presence. Also, watch for any negative
    content about your site - if it’s legitimate criticism (e.g. unresolved customer
    complaints), address it proactively. A pattern of unresolved complaints can tank
    trust.​

7.​ Ensure Technical Trust Factors are in Place: This includes having a valid SSL
    certificate (HTTPS) - an outright requirement nowadays, as users (and
    browsers) will flag non-HTTPS sites as insecure. Also, display trust seals or
    certifications if relevant (for example, if you have a medical site and you follow
    the HONcode, or if you’re e-commerce and have PCI compliance - let users
    know). Make sure your site doesn’t trigger security warnings (no malware, no
    deceptive download prompts). Use clear design and avoid aggressive ads or
    pop-ups, especially on YMYL pages, as these can be seen as signs of low
    quality or even scaminess hobo-web.co.uk. Action: Perform a security audit. If
    you handle user data, have a privacy policy and terms of service accessible -
                                                      144

   beyond legality, it shows transparency about user rights. If you have any
   third-party endorsements or are part of a trusted program (like Google’s News
   Publisher, or a medical accreditation), mention it.​

8.​ Align with Google’s “People-First” Content Guidelines: Ultimately, build
    your site for users, not for Google. Google’s helpful content criteria asks: “Will
    someone reading your content leave feeling like they’ve had a satisfying
    experience?”developers.google.com. If your site is currently filled with
    SEO-driven filler or articles on every trending topic (regardless of your
    expertise), you may have a trust problem. Focus your content scope on what
    you (or your team) truly know and can provide value in. Google is increasingly
    adept at distinguishing content created just to game search from content
    created to genuinely help people. As Danny Sullivan put it, they’re looking to
    reward sites “built on genuine expertise, passion, and trust” and filter out those
    “built purely for flipping and monetization” and hobo-web.co.uk. Action: Do a
    content audit: If you find pages you created solely for traffic with no real value,
    consider pruning or improving them. Stick to a “why” that is user-centric - e.g.
    publishing because you have something unique to share or a problem to solve
    for users. This will naturally enforce a level of authenticity that machines and
    people interpret as trust.​

9.​ If Hit by HCU or a Core Update, Fix Trust Issues First: If you’ve experienced
    a sharp drop in rankings around a known core update or helpful content
    update, and you suspect your site might be seen as a “disconnected” or
    low-trust entity, prioritize the above trust-building steps. Technical SEO or
    minor tweaks won’t bring back traffic if the core issue is Google’s lack of trust
    in your site. John Mueller has advised that sites can “regain traffic by improving
    quality,” but it’s not a simple fix and often requires broad changes that align
    with core updates’ timing hobo-web.co.uk - in other words, you might only
    see recovery when Google reruns its core algorithm, and only if you’ve
    significantly improved what was lacking. Hobo Web’s guidance is even more
    direct: “Any recovery would start with [Section 2.5.2] basic compliance if that is
    what is lacking, because Trust is the overarching signal from E-E-A-T, and
    you can’t have trust without compliance in this area.” hobo-web.co.uk. So,
    start by fixing the trust fundamentals (transparency, E-E-A-T signals) and
                                                      145

      be patient for Google to reassess. During this time, continue adding genuinely
      helpful content and demonstrate to Google that your site is run by responsible,
      real people.​

   10.​Avoid Black-Hat or Deceptive “E–E-A-T” Hacks: Finally, a caution: Do not
       attempt to fake trust signals. Google and users are getting better at sniffing out
       inauthenticity. For instance, don’t create a bogus persona with a stock photo
       and pretend they are the author of all your articles - that can backfire terribly if
       uncovered (and it’s ethically dubious). Don’t buy fake reviews or engage in link
       schemes claiming endorsements. Such tactics violate Google’s guidelines and
       can lead to manual or algorithmic penalties. As I wryly recounted on the Hobo
       SEO Blog, some SEO advice out there encourages people to “fake E-E-A-T with
       fake profiles,” which he calls “extremely grey… Black even!” hobo-web.co.uk.
       It’s not worth risking your site’s integrity. Instead, invest that effort into real
       improvements and genuinely showcasing the expertise you and your team
       possess.​


By following the steps above, you will be aligning your site with Google’s definition of
a high-trust, high-quality site. This not only helps protect you from the negative
impacts of core updates and HCU changes, but it also provides a better experience to
your users (which is the whole point - “helpful content” is content that serves users
well). In many ways, what’s good for users is now clearly good for SEO.

“Trust” is the linchpin

In Google’s modern search landscape, “Trust” is the linchpin of site quality.

The Search Quality Rater Guidelines place trust at the heart of E-E-A-T, and Google’s
core algorithms - reinforced by updates like the Helpful Content Update - increasingly
filter out sites that lack trust signals. “Trust” from Google’s perspective comes from
transparency, credibility, and a positive reputation. Section 2.5.2 of the QRG, asking
“Who is responsible?”, might be the simplest distillation of what webmasters need to
answer on every site they run.

If Google (or users) can’t readily see who stands behind a website and why that site
should be believed, rankings will suffer - as we saw dramatically with many sites in late
2023.

The Disconnected Entity Hypothesis provides a framework to understand these
outcomes: it essentially says trust = connectivity.

A site well-connected” to a known entity (through clear disclosures and associations)
can be trusted; a site that is “disconnected” (operating in the shadows of anonymity
or unclear ownership) is treated as untrustworthy by default, no matter how good its
content might be.

This hypothesis, while not officially confirmed by Google, aligns with everything
Google has been communicating. Google doesn’t want to send users to what it calls
“unhealthy” or questionable web entities. Therefore, our job as webmasters and
SEOs is to present our sites as healthy, trustworthy entities - to prove our
credibility at every opportunity.

To recap, ensuring strong E-E-A-T with an emphasis on Trust involves: clearly
stating who you are (Experience/Expertise are embodied in real people or
organizations), demonstrating authority through real-world credentials or
endorsements, and above all not giving the user or Google any reason to doubt the
honesty, safety, or reliability of your content. I made the Hobo EEAT Tool to help with
this aspect.

It’s an ongoing effort - trust can’t be built overnight, but it can be steadily earned. By
following the principles discussed - drawn from both Google’s guidelines and expert
insights like Hobo Web’s - webmasters can fortify their sites against algorithm
changes and create a better web experience for users. In the end, that is Google’s
goal as well: “to surface great content for users”, which inherently means content
from sources users (and Google) can trust.

By making Trust your SEO north star, you not only please Google’s algorithms, you
build a site that users feel comfortable and confident using - and that is a recipe for
long-term success.

Key Takeaway

Entity SEO is about aligning your online presence with Google’s understanding of the
world.

For small businesses, it’s one of the most powerful ways to punch above your weight.

By turning your business into a well-defined entity that Google can recognize -
through profiles on trusted platforms, structured data, authoritative content, and
consistent signals of credibility - you make it easy for Google to trust and surface your
site.

In my experience, this approach can protect you from algorithm volatility too.

When Google’s systems “know” you and the value you provide, you’re less likely to be
seen as just another generic site. Instead, you become the go-to entity for your niche
or locale.

And as Google’s algorithms continue to evolve, focusing more on semantic
understanding and less on crude keyword matching, investing in Entity SEO is not just
wise - it’s essential. As Dixon bluntly put it, “if you don’t start thinking around entities,
you’re going to be screwed in the end”.

The good news is that by following the steps in this chapter, you’re well on your way to
entity optimization mastery.

You’re helping Google connect the dots about your business - forging the very
connections that can catapult your small business to big visibility.

Build your entity, nurture it, and let Google see the real-world expertise behind your
website. In the long run, this is how you win in SEO: not by tricking an algorithm, but
by building an identity online that algorithms recognize and reward.

Search Engine-First Content - The Impact on the Web and Small
Businesses
Recently, we’ve watched Google wage war on what it calls “search engine-first
content.” This reminds me of other wars - like Panda, Phantom or Penguin and
unnatural links.

In simple terms, this is content created primarily to rank high on Google rather than to
genuinely help readers.

We’ve all encountered it - those webpages stuffed with keywords and generic fluff
that leave you unsatisfied.

Google itself defines search engine-first content as material “created primarily to
rank high in search results rather than to benefit the reader” Google.

In contrast, people-first content is made with the audience’s needs in mind.

Why Google Targeted “Search Engine-First” Content

By 2022, frustration with low-value, SEO-driven content had reached a boiling point.

Users were complaining that search results often led to unoriginal pages designed just
to attract clicks, not inform.

A popular hack at the time was appending “reddit” to Google searches to find
authentic user discussions instead of thin blog posts - a clear sign of dissatisfaction.

Google took notice:

 “We know people don’t find content helpful if it seems like it was designed to attract
clicks rather than inform readers,” one Google announcement explained
theverge.com.

In August 2022, Google responded with a major algorithm change pointedly named
