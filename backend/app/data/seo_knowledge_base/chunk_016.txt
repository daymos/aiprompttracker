Its purpose was to “make sure that unoriginal, low-quality content doesn’t rank
highly in Search”, and instead reward content “made specifically by and for people”

In other words, Google set out to demote the search engine-first pages clogging its
results - those listicles and aggregators adding no unique value - and promote
websites offering original, satisfying information.

     “Content written for the purpose of ranking in search engines - what you
     might call ‘search engine-first content’ - has been frequently written about
     lately and discussed across social media. In short, searchers are getting
     frustrated when they land on unhelpful webpages that rank well because
     they were designed to rank well.” - Barry Schwartz, Search Engine Land
     (summarizing Google’s view) searchengineland.com

Google’s own spokespeople have been very vocal in promoting this people-first
philosophy.

Danny Sullivan, Google’s Search Liaison, emphasized that Google wants to reward
helpful content above all. “Quality signals - like helpfulness - matter more,”

The message from Google is clear: pages created just to game SEO, without real
expertise or value, are increasingly likely to be filtered out.

Their automated systems now ask, “Who, How, and Why” for each piece of content -
who made it, how it was created, and why (was it to genuinely help users, or just to
rank?) developers.google.comdevelopers.google.com.

Content that fails these sniff tests is prone to be flagged as unhelpful.

In fact, Google explicitly warns creators to “avoid creating search engine-first
content” and provides self-assessment questions as red flags.

For example: “Is the content primarily made to attract visits from search
engines?”; “Are you using extensive automation to produce content on many
topics?”; “Are you mainly summarizing what others have said without adding much
value?” developers.google.comdevelopers.google.com.

Answering yes to questions like these is a sign that a page was made for search
rankings rather than readers - precisely what Google’s new updates target.
