# The Helpful Content Update (HCU)

The Helpful Content Update (HCU)




Google’s Helpful Content Update (HCU) launched in late August 2022 and has been
updated several times since. It marked one of the most significant search algorithm
changes in a decade searchengineland.com. To understand its impact, let’s look at the
key milestones of HCU and what each brought:

   ●​ August 2022 - Initial Launch: Rolled out for English searches globally. This
      update introduced a new site-wide ranking signal to identify and devalue
      websites with a high amount of unhelpful, “search engine-first”
      contentsearchengineland.com and searchengineland.com. Google’s goal was
      to “help searchers find high-quality content” by rewarding pages “written for
      humans” and downgrading those written solely to ranksearchengineland.com
      and searchengineland.com. Early communication from Google stressed that
      this was an “ongoing effort” to reduce low-quality, unoriginal content on the
      web searchengineland.com.​

   ●​ December 2022 - Global Expansion: The helpful content system was
      expanded beyond English to cover all languages globally hobo-web.co.uk.
      Google also improved its classifier’s ability to detect low-quality content.
      (Notably, this December HCU update took 4–5 weeks to fully roll out, indicating
      the scale of the change.) hobo-web.co.uk. By this point, webmasters in all

      regions needed to ensure their sites weren’t filled with SEO-first filler content.​

   ●​ September 2023 - Refinements: Google rolled out another HCU update with
      some important tweaks. It clarified that using AI or automation without
      oversight could be risky, and warned against posting content from third parties
      “without adding value” - reinforcing that simply republishing or aggregating
      content isn’t considered helpful hobo-web.co.uk. Google also provided more
      guidance on recovery, acknowledging site owners’ concerns. (Interestingly,
      around this time Google softened its stance on AI-generated content if it was
      helpful and met their guidelines, focusing less on the how and more on the
      quality of the result.)​

   ●​ March 2024 - Integration into Core Algorithm: A major turning point came
      when Google fully integrated the helpful content system into its core ranking
      algorithm hobo-web.co.uk and hobo-web.co.uk. HCU was no longer a one-off
      update but an always-on part of how Google ranks pages. Google’s search
      engineers reported that these efforts had already led to a significant purge of
      unhelpful material online - roughly a 40–45% reduction in low-quality content
      showing up in search results searchengineland.com and hobo-web.co.uk. In
      short, nearly half of the shallow “made for SEO” stuff had been swept aside
      (according to Google’s measurements) by early 2024. Google also introduced
      new spam-fighting policies in tandem, underscoring that trustworthiness and
      transparency are crucial for content to be deemed helpful hobo-web.co.uk and
      hobo-web.co.uk. Sullivan put it plainly: the helpful content system is now a
      “core ranking system that’s assessing helpfulness” across all types of
      searches hobo-web.co.uk - a permanent part of Google’s DNA moving forward.​


It’s worth noting that HCU was designed as a site-wide signal from the start
searchengineland.com.

If a large portion of your website is filled with unhelpful content made just for search
engines, your entire site can be held back in Google’s rankings.

This made the update especially scary for publishers - even your good pages could be
dragged down if Google determined that your site, overall, was guilty of producing too
much fluff: searchengineland.com and searchengineland.com.

Still, the exact mechanics remain opaque. What’s clear is that Google expects a
“people-first” focus site-wide, not just a few high-quality pages masking a pile of
SEO spam.)

Who was most likely to get hit? Google initially pointed out a few content areas that
“may be impacted the most”: online education, arts & entertainment, shopping, and
tech-related content searchengineland.com.

These were niches where, historically, creators churned out articles mainly to rank -
think of thin “how-to” posts, auto-generated lyrics or synopsis sites, product roundup
blogs written by affiliates, etc.

Sure enough, many affiliate marketing sites, generic how-to blogs, and content farms
saw their traffic plummet once HCU rolled out.

Meanwhile, genuine expert sites and community forums (even Reddit threads) began
to rise higher for certain queries, aligning with Google’s goal of surfacing unique
information you haven’t seen before: searchengineland.com and
searchengineland.com. In Google’s eyes, this was a net win for searchers. But for
many site owners, especially small businesses relying on content marketing, the real
story of HCU was just beginning - and it wasn’t a happy one.

Impact on Small Businesses and Publishers




From my vantage point, with access to hundreds of HCU hit sites, the impact of the
Helpful Content updates on a particular type of site has been devastating.

Almost immediately after the first HCU in 2022, forum threads and social media lit up
with stories of traffic crashes.

Many of these were small or medium-sized sites that had invested heavily in content
creation as a marketing strategy.

A lot of affiliate bloggers and niche informational sites (the kind run by solo
entrepreneurs or small teams) were particularly hard hit.

Google effectively declared that much of this content wasn’t up to snuff in terms of
authenticity or value - and the algorithms dealt out harsh punishment in the rankings.

All across the world, small businesses and indie publishers are reeling from HCU’s
effects.

On SEO communities, you’ll find countless reports of sites that lost 20%, 50%, even
90% of their organic traffic after being deemed “unhelpful.” Some were thin-content
sites churning out articles on every trending topic - arguably deserving of a hit.

But others were heartfelt projects by subject enthusiasts or entrepreneurs trying to
share knowledge while earning a living.

This is alarming for web diversity.

Small businesses feel they’re being squeezed out, not necessarily because their
content is bad, but possibly because they lack the brand authority signals that Google
now heavily favors (as I discussed earlier).

Morgan, a creator from the site Charleston Crafted, described the disconnect felt by
many at the Google Creator Summit. She felt Google's representatives acknowledged
the quality of their work but then offered solutions that missed the mark. Morgan
testified, "You have good content. You are good creators…. But they really
wanted to go off on different tangents about setting up a profile or getting you
verified." She expressed her frustration, stating, "I feel they were going down the
wrong trail… a Google Profile, a bio…." This perfectly captures the feeling that
Google was focusing on surface-level identity signals while publishers felt their core
content was being ignored.

It is very worth noticing about that… Google profile a bio…. Comment.

A Hard Road to Recovery (Or None at All)
“Fix” is hard to say when it comes to relevancy, but I’d assume bigger changes would
be visible when the next CORE UPDATES happen.” John Mueller, Google

When your website gets dinged by the Helpful Content system, how easy is it to
recover?

By Google’s design, and from what I’ve witnessed, not very easy.

In fact it can signal the death knell for your site.

The collective sentiment of the affected community is powerfully captured in
questions posed in online forums.

One publisher asked, “Assuming a site hit by HCU in 2023 has fixed everything
that caused the sitewide classifier to be applied, what is the timeframe for the
site to start climbing again?” This was followed by the more desperate and widely
shared observation: “We are many that would really love a reply to why not a
single HCU-hit site have begun climbing again and why new articles won’t
rank.”

The “helpful content” classifier that labels a site as unhelpful can stay in effect for
months, or years even after you improve your pages.

Google intentionally made this signal persistent, in order to discourage
quick-and-dirty fixes.

In practice, many site owners hit by HCU have found themselves in a long game of
waiting - or a hopeless spiral of no recovery at all - as I warned a few of them in
November 2024 and in my February 202 article when I first looked into the HCU
impact on small publishers.

Google’s official line is that sites can recover if they significantly improve content
quality, but “returning to pre-update levels isn’t realistic” in many cases.

John Mueller, a Google Search advocate, bluntly stated that if a site was heavily
affected, simply fixing a few things won’t bounce it back to where it was.

                                                          157

According to Mueller, these aren’t quick technical penalties you can lift; rather, they
often require fundamental changes to a site’s approach. “These are not ‘recoveries’ in
the sense that someone fixes a technical issue and they’re back on track - they are
essentially changes in a business’s priorities,” Mueller explained hobo-web.co.uk.

In other words, a website that thrived on search engine first content might need to
completely rethink its strategy (and even its business model) to align with what
Google now wants.

That’s a very bitter pill to swallow for a small business that, say, built its audience over
years by writing lots of search-optimised articles.

Google is basically saying: “Your old approach won’t cut it anymore. It’s not just one
thing to fix - you might have to overhaul your whole content philosophy.”

This stance was highlighted in late 2024, when Google took the step of inviting some
affected publishers to a private “Web Creator Summit.”

The company ostensibly wanted to hear out those who had been “strongly impacted”
by HCU and discuss solutions.

Unfortunately, by many accounts, that meeting only heightened publishers’
frustrations.

Several attendees reported that Google’s representatives acknowledged the
publishers had good content, but “Google’s systems could not detect that” and
thus treated them as low-quality mariehaynes.com and mariehaynes.com. Perhaps
most infuriating was the lack of a hopeful timeline: Google offered “little hope… for
recovery any time soon”.

In fact, when one affected site owner asked Google’s Danny Sullivan what he would do
if he had a website hit by the helpful content update, Sullivan’s response was
astonishingly candid.

He said, “I’d do something else in the meantime.” In other words, don’t count on
Google search traffic returning - go work on other channels or projects.

According to another attendee, Google’s advice was even more blunt: “If you were hit
by HCU do not expect a recovery anytime soon. Move on.”See Marie Haynes
research here: mariehaynes.com.

You can imagine how demoralizing it is for a small business owner to be told by
Google to essentially give up on the organic search traffic they’d lost.

Telling a business to just forget about that lost traffic (which may have been their main
source of customers), no matter how pragmatic, felt a little tone-deaf.

The data on recoveries backs up Google’s pessimism.

By late 2023, only a minority of sites had seen any rebound. SEO analyst Glenn Gabe
tracked roughly 400 websites that were hit hard by the September 2023 HCU update.

He found that after a full year - which included multiple core updates and another
helpful content tweak - only 22% of those sites had managed even a modest 20% or
greater increase in organic traffic seroundtable.com.

“Some [sites] have shown full recoveries but most did not,”

Gabe reported, noting that “most [sites] saw no lifts at all.” Even among the
“recoveries,” many were partial and volatile (a surge during one Google update, then a
drop off in the next) seroundtable.com.

Full restoration to pre-2022 traffic levels was “an anomaly,” Gabe observed -
essentially a rare lucky case seroundtable.com. And tellingly, a portion of sites
continued to decline even further with subsequent updates seroundtable.com. This
paints a grim picture: once labeled unhelpful, a site often stays in the dog house.

Some webmasters have thrown in the towel, either pivoting their sites to entirely
different topics, or abandoning projects altogether because they “can’t afford to
continue… with no traffic” seroundtable.com.

From Google’s perspective, this slow or non-existent recovery is not a flaw - it’s by
design.

They want to permanently discourage the kind of content strategies that HCU
targeted.

But from the small business perspective, it feels like being hit by a truck.

There’s a growing sentiment that Google is abandoning smaller sites.

As one attendee at the summit summed it up, Google basically told them “there’s
nothing wrong with your sites, it’s us” - meaning the search algorithm had changed in
ways that collateral damage was inevitable - and that they (Google) didn’t really know
how to fix it for those edge cases.

That admission, “we can’t give you any guarantees”, coupled with “that is not going to
change”, was a little chilling.

It means that even good content can fall through the cracks of Google’s system, and
Google’s best advice is to keep improving or find other avenues, because the
dominance of “people-first” signals is here to stay.

Highlighting the grim reality of HCU's impact, creator Mike Hardaker stated bluntly,
“We’re now 13 months since the HCU update rolled out, I don’t believe a single
website has recovered.”

This sentiment was echoed by another publisher, who, according to your research,
was told by Google that his "content was not the issue."

This creates a powerful contradiction: if the content isn't the problem and yet no one
is recovering, it points directly to a deeper, more fundamental issue.

The E-E-A-T Factor
Google also tied the helpful content effort to its broader quality guidelines known as
E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). In Google’s view,
trustworthiness is the foundation of content quality hobo-web.co.uk.

That means who is creating the content, and why, matters a great deal. Pages that
don’t clearly indicate authorship, or sites that hide who is responsible for the content,
inherently lack trust in Google’s eyes and are unlikely to be deemed “helpful”.

This is one reason many small affiliate sites may have gotten hit - they often were
made to look generic, with no real author bios or brand identity, just a factory of SEO
articles.

Google now strongly encourages adding accurate authorship information to establish
trust - for both the site (which can be the Primary Author too) and the creator.

If a website fails to demonstrate transparency about its creators and purpose, “it
completely violates Google’s helpfulness standard - full stop,” as I’ve written
before on hobo-web.co.uk.

In fact, Google’s algorithms can sometimes judge a site as untrustworthy before even
analyzing the specific page content, simply because the site doesn’t meet basic
E-E-A-T markers (for instance, an “About Us” page, author credentials, etc.).

This focus on trust and expertise is something many supporters of HCU applaud - it
raises the bar for professionalism in content.

Small businesses that treated their site as a serious publication, showcasing real
expertise and credentials, tend to fare better than those that cranked out
cookie-cutter blog posts anonymously.

Even some of the initially skeptical SEOs have come around to the idea that Google’s
approach forces better content creation practices.

The era of tricking your way to the top with SEO gimmicks is fading. As an industry,
SEO is (painfully) being reminded that serving the user should be priority number one.

There’s a renewed emphasis on first-hand experience in content - something Google
explicitly rewards.

For example, Google hinted that for travel queries, they’d prefer content by people
who have actually visited the places they write about hobo-web.co.uk and
hobo-web.co.uk.

If you’re a small travel business that actually goes on tours and shares unique photos
and stories, you - theoretically - have a better chance now against a faceless travel
affiliate site.

That’s encouraging for genuine small operators, but it's a seismic shift in who is
expected to create content in 2025.

A rule of thumb for me is who created a type of content today, might not be who is
creating that type of content tomorrow.

Furthermore, some observers note that user satisfaction with Google results has
improved after these updates.

Google itself claims that thanks to HCU (and related changes), searchers are 40%
less likely to land on unhelpful pages now searchengineland.com.

And remember that “reddit hack” for getting better results?

Google’s tweaks in late 2022 were seen as “particularly helpful to anyone using the
append ‘reddit’ trick” theverge.com - meaning Google started surfacing more real
user forum content and authentic reviews on its own.

In fact, queries for many products began to automatically show a “Discussions”
section or even Reddit links, indicating Google’s algorithms were actively boosting
community content where appropriate.

We can only trust it has little to do with any financial agreements Google has with
Reddit (although that in itself is a big concern for many).

Ongoing Debate: The Future of Content and Small Businesses
The advent of the Helpful Content system has undoubtedly reshaped the SEO
landscape.

On the one hand, search engine-first content and non-transparent entities are being
purged from Google SERPs for the betterment of user experience - and that’s hard to
argue against.

Small businesses that have true expertise and that publish high-quality, authentic
content can still thrive; in fact, they have a better shot at standing out now if they do
things right.

On the other hand, many legitimate small publishers have been caught in the
crossfire.

Their plight has been voiced by some of the most vocal critics of HCU.

Content creators at the summit outright told Google that “there was nothing wrong
with our sites” - the content was good, but Google’s algorithms simply didn’t surface
it.

Google’s response has been unsatisfying to say the least, essentially: we’re focused
on what users want, and we’re not turning back.

For small business owners who built their success on Google Search, that feels like
the rules of the game changed suddenly and the referee won’t hear an appeal.

Some critics have gone as far as suggesting ulterior motives.

They point out that Google makes the vast majority of its revenue from advertising.

If organic (free) visibility becomes harder for small businesses, where will those
businesses turn?

Likely to Google Ads, spending money to regain exposure. It’s a cynical take, but not
unheard of.

Small businesses need to adapt. The age of easy SEO traffic by pumping out lots of
mediocre articles is over.

To succeed now, you truly have to put users first in your content strategy - just as
Google has been preaching.

That means focusing on your niche expertise, demonstrating your experience, being
transparent about who you are, and genuinely answering the questions your audience
has (better than anyone else).

It also means diversifying - relying solely on Google traffic is risky if an algorithm can
wipe you out overnight.

We’ve seen creators like myself start exploring alternatives like social media,
newsletters, or even other search platforms.

Interestingly, as Google squeezes some types of content, users are exploring things
like AI chatbots (ChatGPT) or community sites for answers.

The competition for how people find information is heating up, and Google’s moves
might inadvertently drive some users elsewhere if its results favor only big players or
too many ads.

Google’s crusade against search-engine-first content - embodied by the Helpful
Content Update and related changes - has profoundly impacted the web
ecosystem.

It’s cleaned up a lot of spam and pushed creators to be better, but it has also left
many small businesses feeling like collateral damage.

I want the web to be filled with helpful, authentic content (and I support Google’s goal
there). Yet I’ve also witnessed business owners in distress because an update slashed
their traffic by 80% and they’re not sure how to pay their bills now.

The balance between improving search quality and not stifling the little guys is a
delicate one.

Google, for its part, appears firm: people-first content is the future, and there’s no
reversal in sight. “I expect if we see incremental improvements, that might be
reflected in incremental ranking changes,” Danny Sullivan said - meaning recovery, if it
comes, will be slow and earned hobo-web.co.uk.

In other words, adapt and improve steadily, or risk fading away.

As we move forward, small businesses and content creators must take these lessons
to heart.

The ones who survive and thrive will be those who genuinely align with what Google’s
trying to reward: unique expertise, trustworthiness, and true helpfulness to users.

It’s not an easy path - and it’s certainly not always “fair” in the short term - but it is
the new reality of SEO we have to deal with.

In my view, search engine-first content had its run (and made plenty of money for
some), but people-first content is the only sustainable strategy now for anyone
who publishes on the web. The only other option I can think of in terms outside of
people-first content, is ironically AI targeted content - Content made for AI with AI -
which I go into in my article: Optimise for the Synthetic Content Data Layer
Opportunity Gap.

The challenge for small businesses is to embrace this ethos without losing their
livelihoods in the transition.

And the challenge for Google is to continue refining its systems so that truly great,
user-focused content - even from the smallest sites - gets the visibility it deserves,
while the cheats and the spam fade into history - while at the same time, deal with the
accusation from many quarters is that it is killing the open web.

The story is still unfolding, and as an SEO, I’ll be watching (and adjusting) every step of
the way.
