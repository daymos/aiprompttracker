Full source: Court PDF



1. User Data as a Core Input

      “User data is a critical input that directly improves [search] quality. Google
      utilizes user data at every stage of the search process, from crawling and
      indexing to retrieval and ranking.”​

2. Learning from User Feedback

      “Learning from this user feedback is perhaps the central way that web
      ranking has improved for 15 years.”​

3. Page Scoring in Crawling

      “Google assigns a score to the pages it crawls, and it endeavors to exclude
      from its web search index pages without value to users, such as
      spam-heavy or pornographic pages. Google also relies on various ‘ranking
      signals’… Among Google’s top-level signals are those measuring a web
      page’s quality and popularity.”​

4. Quality & Popularity Signals in Crawling

      “Quality and popularity signals, for instance, help Google determine how
      frequently to crawl web pages to ensure the index contains the freshest
      web content.”​

5. PageRank as an Input to Quality Score

      “PageRank… is a single signal relating to distance from a known good
      source, and it is used as an input to the Quality score.”​

6. Source of Quality Signals

      “Most of Google’s quality signal is derived from the webpage itself.”​

7. Human Raters as Training Data for RankEmbed

      “The data underlying RankEmbed models is a combination of
      click-and-query data and scoring of web pages by human raters.”​

8. Direct Role of Rater Scores

      “RankEmbed and its later iteration RankEmbedBERT are ranking models
      that rely on two main sources of data: % of 70 days of search logs plus
      scores generated by human raters…”​

9. Rater Data Improves Long-Tail Search

      “RankEmbedBERT was again one of those very strong impact things, and it
      particularly helped with long-tail queries where language understanding is
      that much more important.”​
      View in PDF



10. Raw vs. Deep-Learning Ranking Signals

      “Google uses signals to score and rank web pages… Signals range in
      complexity. There are ‘raw’ signals, like the number of clicks, the content of
      a web page, and the terms within a query… At the other end… innovative
      deep-learning models… like RankEmbedBERT.”​

      Source: Pages 141–142



11. Spam Score as a Quality Signal

      “So, too, does the spam score… Query data is also important to ensuring
      that the search index contains the pages that are responsive to users’
      queries.”​

      “Every [user] interaction gives us another example, another bit of training
      data: for this query, a human believed that result would be most relevant.”​

15. Freshness & Long-Tail Queries

      “Comprehensiveness of the index is crucial… Freshness, or the recency of
      information, is an important factor in search quality. GSEs need to know
      how to recrawl sites… especially for long-tail queries.”​

17. Glue & Navboost Data (Super Query Logs)

      “Glue is essentially a ‘super query log’… The data underlying Glue consists
      of… (1) the query (text, language, location, device type); (2) ranking info (10
      blue links, triggered search features); (3) SERP interactions (clicks, hovers,
      dwell time); (4) query interpretation (spelling correction, salient terms). An
      important component of the Glue data is Navboost… a ‘memorization
      system’ that aggregates click-and-query data.”​

18. RankEmbed Training Data = Quality Edge

      “The RankEmbed data is a ‘small fraction’ of Google’s overall traffic, but
      the RankEmbed models trained on that data have directly contributed to
      the company’s quality edge over competitors.”​

19. User-Side Data Defined (Click & Query Logs)

      “User-side Data is data Google collects from the pairing of a user query
      and the returned response… Examples include: links clicked, hover time,
      pogo-sticking (click back), and dwell time. User-interaction data is the raw
      material Google uses to improve search services.”​

20. Quality Measures & PageRank as Authoritativeness

      “A key quality signal is PageRank, which captures a web page’s quality and
      authoritativeness based on the frequency and importance of the links
      connecting to it… and is used as an input to the Quality score.”​
      View in PDF with highlight​

21. Spam Scores & Device-Type Flags in Indexing

      “The spam score will allow rivals to avoid crawling web pages of low value
      and focus only on those with helpful content. Finally, the device-type flag
      will enable competitors to close the mobile scale gap by identifying and
      focusing on mobile-friendly websites.”​

22. User Interaction Signals (Clicks, Hovers, Pogo-Sticking, Dwell Time)

      “Examples of such data include the web link or vertical information the
      user clicks on, how long a user hovers over a link, and whether the user
      clicks back from a web page and how quickly… User-interaction data is the
      raw material that Google uses to improve search services.”​

26. Index Size & the “80–20 Problem”

      “The size of Google’s index gives it a key competitive advantage… Building
      a search index that can answer 80% of queries is attainable, but answering
      the remaining 20% — the long-tail queries — is particularly challenging.”​

The Black Hat Perspective: Understanding the Other Side

“Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o' the milk of human kindness To catch the
nearest way” Lady Macbeth

While this book advocates for sustainable, white-hat strategies, a complete
understanding of the search landscape requires acknowledging the black hat
community.

Paying attention to their methods – not to replicate them, but to understand the
vulnerabilities they exploit - offers invaluable insight into what Google is fighting
against and where the algorithm's boundaries lie.
