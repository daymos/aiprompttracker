2025-11-10T22:44:17.703,assistant,"SEO revolves around three pillars: technical health (site speed, mobile‑friendliness, crawlability), on‑page relevance (keyword‑rich titles, meta tags, structured content, internal linking) and authority (high‑quality backlinks and brand signals). Start by ensuring your site loads fast, uses HTTPS, and has a clean URL structure; then map target keywords to each page, crafting compelling, user‑focused titles and headings that match search intent. Build authority through earned links from reputable sites, guest posts, and by creating shareable, data‑driven content that naturally attracts citations. Regularly monitor performance—track rankings, click‑through rates, and traffic trends—to spot quick wins and adjust your strategy. Let me know if you’d like deeper guidance on any of these areas or specific tactics for your projects."
